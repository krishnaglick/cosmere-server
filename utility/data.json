      "Wayne's ability to mimic and create accents is used to great effect in the book, and Michael Kramer really shines in bringing these accents to life in the audiobook. Did you have a sense when writing the book that these could be challenging—and rewarding—scenes when read?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I certainly did. The thing is, I'm not good with talking in accents myself—I can hear them in my head, but I'm atrocious at trying to do them. So while I was writing the book, I was thinking in the back of my mind, \"I really hope that poor Michael can pull this off.\" It was a lot of fun to write Wayne's accents. I'm writing in a world that isn't our world, but the Mistborn world is a bit of an Earth analogue. I intentionally used themes that make it an Earth parallel, which is different from my other worlds. So you can have a character who kind of has a light Cockney accent or something like that, but it's not our world so it can't exactly mimic that accent. So it's already a challenge in that respect. I do think Michael did a fantastic job."

Then I go, trying to build a rise to a climax (however small) within that scene.\r\nThat's how it is for most middle chapters.

      "What can readers expect from the second volume of The Stormlight Archive? Any tentative title or release date?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I originally had titled the second book Highprince of War. I'm not sure if I will keep that title, depending on who its central character ends up being. With the Stormlight Archive, I am playing with the form of the epic fantasy novel in a way that's very exciting to me that I haven't done since Elantris. If you read Elantris, the form of that book was very important in how it developed, with its chapter triad system. The books in this series also have a very specific form. Each book will focus on one character. That character will get flashbacks exploring their past, to show you how they arrived where they are. But the book will progress the narrative for everyone. For instance, this book was Kaladin's book, and you got flashbacks for him. He will appear substantially in the next book, and you'll have lots of viewpoints from him, but it will be someone else's book and that character will get flashbacks. Each book will have one central character, with two or three major characters who have no flashbacks and not quite as much screen time—characters like Dalinar and Shallan in the first book, and to a lesser extent Adolin and Szeth.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that will continue is the interludes. I really enjoyed including those in the book; I'm not sure what people will think of them, but most of them are essentially going to be short stories set somewhere in the world, that enhance the main narrative and show different aspects of the world without forcing you to follow yet another plotline. They're just quick one-offs. You'll see those between parts in all of the other books.\r\n\r\nTentative release date? I have to finish A Memory of Light first. I don�t know how long that will take to write. In a perfect world, which is probably not going to happen, the ideal case is that I�m able to finish A Memory of Light by around August of 2011, whereupon it gets published in November 2011 and I start Stormlight Two January of the next year and it's ready for publication in November 2012. That would be the ideal situation. I often do manage to hit the deadlines in ideal situations, but I'm not making any promises on this one. I'm thinking 2012 spring is more likely for A Memory of Light, but we'll see."

      "Okay. So Brandon writes very fast, something people always point out. Something we wanted to know though from Brandon was, what in his mind is it he looks for in order for a book to be ready for release?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "That's an excellent question that's going to be very difficult to answer. I will say on my speed that I'm not a really fast writer; I'm a persistent writer. I don't take time off. I just write, and I write every day. And that piles up. I think I'm just very fortunate�I have an advantage over a lot of authors in that I don't get writer's block. I don't necessarily write any faster than those authors, but I don't stop; I just keep going. And if you write ten pages a day�which is about what I do, which is not a ton�a lot of authors produce ten pages a day when they're writing, then they hit hang ups, they hit writer's block and things; and that doesn't happen to me, certainly not very often. And so I just write consistently, and I just love to do this, and so... But that's not an indication of quality really, in either way. One of the things I found becoming a writer is some books go fast, some books go slowly. And the reader can't usually tell because a lot of good quality books happen really fast and a lot of good quality books happen very slowly. If you look at Pat Rothfuss' books, Wise Man's Fear took us years to get and is a fantastic book worth every moment of the wait. But some of the great classics like... A Christmas Carol is a famous one�took only a few days to write. And that's happened with various books and classics through history, so we don't really...yeah. Speed is one thing.\r\nWhat makes a book ready? For me, a lot of whether a book is going to be ready or not comes in, 'Can I fix the problems?' 'Cause every book has problems when I write them. I do write very... I write my drafts beginning to end, pretty quick drafts. And then I need to spend a great deal of time tweaking them, fixing them, going over them again. I write my books much like a sculptor might create a sculpture. And we start...you know, the first pass over doesn't make it look much like a fix; you're just chopping off chunks. And then you refine, and then you refine, and then finally you're sanding. Get these little tiny imperfections out. And that's how I write. My first pass through is...I'm laying down character, dialogue, and plot. I'm not doing description. And in a lot of cases, I'm not doing�for instance, I'm doing a lot of telling rather than showing, because I'm getting on the page what needs to happen. And then I need to go back and take out huge chunks of, you know, people standing up and monologuing. Instead make this actually interesting. If that makes sense. So you get the whole story in the first draft, but it would be boring. And the first draft also often introduces lots of big problems. And when I do my revisions, I need to fix those problems. Primarily, can I get the characters right? Almost every time I write a book, one of the characters, there's something wrong with them. And I need to finish the book before I can figure out what it is that's wrong with them. And the book is ready when I've got them right. At that point, it's a matter of polishing, and the polishing, though it takes time, is easy. No, it's not easy... That's the wrong term. The polishing is expected; it can be done. If I take the right amount of time, I will polish it correctly. But...it's those pieces right before that need to be fixed.",

So, I wrote The Way of Kings in 2002, the first version, and in that version Kaladin trained with a swordmaster, and that swordmaster, a guy named Vasher, had a mysterious past. After I finished that book, later on I wrote Warbreaker as a prequel to The Way of Kings, to show Vasher's backstory. But then Warbreaker came out before The Way of Kings, which was a really kind of interesting thing. So in my head, Warbreaker is the prequel, but to everyone else...\r\nYes, it is a totally different world, different planets, people get around...\r\n\r\nWetlander\r\nSo how much of Vasher's backstory do we actually have?\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nWell, a huge chunk of it!

      "PART TWO: BUFFERS AND MY WRITING SPEED\r\n\r\nBecause of this, and because of my writing style, I need a little bit of a break before I tackle it. I pushed myself very hard to get both Towers of Midnight and The Way of Kings ready for publication this year. Even then, it was only possible because I had written a sizable chunk of Towers of Midnight while working on The Gathering Storm AND because I'd already finished an early version of The Way of Kings.\r\n\r\nPeople have mentioned before that I am somewhat prolific. Some of this is an illusion. For a while now, I've been warning people that we've been chewing through my buffer at a frightening rate. Once upon a time, I would turn in a book three years before it was scheduled to come out. This gave me a lot of wiggle room. If a book wasn't working, I could shelve it and think about it, then get back to it. Working that far ahead prevents most big crunches.\r\n\r\nHowever, the books I've been working on lately were a little more high profile than previous ones�and high-profile books get released when they get turned in, not three years later. So, though I took eighteen months finishing The Gathering Storm, it looked like I finished it very quickly. (I turned it in during the summer of 2009, and it came out in the fall of 2009. Warbreaker came out that same year, though I'd turned it in back in 2006.) The very long write of that book was invisible to a lot of readers because books I'd written years before continued to come out while I was working on it.\r\n\r\nThe buffer is gone now. I'll talk more about that later. However, I want to mention something else that helps me be productive�and that's allowing myself deviations to keep myself interested. I've told people before that I wrote the Alcatraz books to give me a break between Mistborn novels. If I'm able to refresh myself on other projects, I don't get burned out on the big epics. (Which are my true love, but can be very demanding on me mentally.)"

I almost always spend a few months working on the world before writing; it's the thing I feel I need best fleshed out. However, it is dangerous as well. Some writers spend all of their time worldbuilding and none of their time writing.\r\n\r\nI try to focus my energies on areas of worldbuilding important to the conflict and the characters. In Mistborn, the languages weren't important�I was going to have everyone speaking one language. In Kings, language was more important, so I developed the linguistics.

      "You've established a reputation as a writer of genre fiction (fantasy). Many LDS writers (Orson Scott Card; Glen Larson) have used the genre of speculative fiction, broadly speaking. Is there something uniquely LDS about speculative fiction (or perhaps something uniquely speculative about the LDS mindset)?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "This is, actually, a common question—one I get from LDS people as well as from New York, where they see an unusual number of fantasy authors coming from Utah. Utah readers also tend to buy more fantasy and sf books than a lot of other states. My guess is that there are many things coming together to cause these trends.\r\nFirst off, I think LDS culture emphasizes learning and reading in general. We grow up reading from the scriptures, and our prophet speaks often about the importance of education. Because of this, I think that there are just a lot of very literate people in our culture—and that translates to more writers and more readers.\r\nBeyond that, fantasy has a tradition of having strong values (two of the most foundational authors in the genre are C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, who both dealt a lot with good against evil and used Christian themes in their writing.) Because of this, fantasy attracts religious people, I think. Even something as generally un-religious as Harry Potter deals with the tradition of the good and the pure struggling against the corrupt and the evil.\r\nFinally, I think that the LDS religion—despite what some detractors may say—is far more open and accepting of new thoughts and ideas than other religious cultures. To an LDS reader, the concept of other populated worlds isn't threatening."

If you asked a lot of authors that question, they'll say, \"Oh, I wrote my first book when I was in first grade, and ever since then I wanted to be a writer.\" Well, I didn't start off as a writer. I actually had a big period in my life where I didn't like to read, didn't like books at all. And it wasn't until I was in junior high and a teacher handed me a fantasy novel that it really all started."

      "The Rithmatist is out! Buy it from the links to the right or visit your local bookstore. (In the UK/Australia, the release date is May 23rd.) My book tour starts tonight in New York and continues in Philadelphia, Denver, Omaha, New Orleans, Houston, San Jose, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Provo, and Spanish Fork. For details see my events page. (And note, as always I'm happy to sign any books you bring to a signing. Don't feel bad showing up to a signing for The Rithmatist carrying your copy of A Memory of Light. I'll sign it gladly. And if you want me to send you an email when I'll be signing near you, tell me your city here.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm super excited about The Rithmatist. Imagine a world where people duel using a magical, StarCraft-like system where one draws units and structures in chalk. Those come to life once you complete them, though they remain two dimensional, and you can use any drawing surface as a dueling platform. The main character, Joel, gets to go to a school specializing in this magic, though he can't actually use it himself. (He is the son of the cleaning lady, so he gets free tuition.) Students start disappearing, and he gets mixed up in the mystery.\r\n\r\nThis book is a favorite among my beta readers. (The Rithmatist has been around in draft form for some six years now, so many of the inner circle of my fans have read it already.) It's a fun, quick read that (hopefully) will tide you over while I'm finishing up Stormlight 2, Words of Radiance. (About 80% done with that right now.)\r\n\r\nWhile I love my Alcatraz series for younger readers, that series is very bizarre and quite different from the style of my adult books. I've found that many of my readers wish I had something more \"Brandonesque\" to hand to their younger siblings, children, nieces and nephews, etc. Well, this is the book for you. Deep worldbuilding, a complex magic system, and a sharp plot.\r\n\r\nHopefully you'll all be willing to give it a look. The sample chapters are here and you can hear the beginning of the audiobook here.\r\n\r\nRead onward on this blog post if you want to hear some of the background of The Rithmatist and how it came to be. Otherwise, check out those sample chapters, and come see me on tour!"

      "OK... you�re not going to ask me the �what would you ask me� question?Open The FridgeNot quite...Brandon Sanderson OK good, because I hate that one! (laughs)Open The FridgeMy question is if there�s anything that you�ve never been asked that you would like to talk about?Brandon SandersonOooooh, ok. Hm. That one is so hard! Every time people ask me something like this... What have I never been asked that people should be asking, is basically what the question is? Something that the fans have just missed... They pick up on so much, that it�s hard... I do wonder if, you know� all the magic systems [in my books] are connected and work on some basic fundamental principles, and a lot of people haven�t been asking questions about this. One thing I did get a question on today, and I�ll just talk about this one... they didn�t ask the right question, but I nudged them the right way, is understanding that tie between Aondor [the magic system from Elantris] and allomancy [Mistborn�s magic system].People ask about getting the power from metals and things, but that�s not actually how it works. The power�s not coming from metal. I talked a little about this before, but you are drawing power from some source, and the metal is actually just a gateway. It�s actually the molecular structure of the metal� what�s going on there, the pattern, the resonance of that metal works in the same way as an Aon does in Elantris. It filters the power. So it is just a sign of �this is what power this energy is going to be shaped into and give you.� When you understand that, compounding [in Alloy of Law] makes much more sense.  Compounding is where you are able to kind of draw in more power than you should with feruchemy. What�s going on there is you�re actually charging a piece of metal, and then you are burning that metal as a feruchemical charge. What is happening is that the feruchemical charge overwrites the allomantic charge, and so you actually fuel feruchemy with allomancy, is what you are doing. Then if you just get out another piece of metal and store it in, since you�re not drawing the power from yourself, you�re cheating the system, you�re short-circuiting the system a little bit. So you can actually use the power that usually fuels allomancy, to fuel feruchemy, which you can then store in a metalmind, and basically build up these huge reservoirs of it. So what�s going on there is� imagine there�s like, an imprint, a wavelength, so to speak. A beat for an allomantic thing, that when you burn a metal, it says �ok, this is what power we give.� When it�s got that charge, it changes that beat and says, �now we get this power.� And you access a set of feruchemical power. That�s why compounding is so powerful."

      "On the origins of the Mistborn series and his writing process:\r\n\r\n\"I'm always searching for ideas that I can connect into a larger story. I feel that a book is more than just one idea. A good book is a collection of ideas, a good idea for each character, something that forms the core of their conflict. Some ideas come from the setting, or something that's going to drive the economy, something that's going to, for me, drive the magic [system].\"\r\n\r\nBrandon continued to explain his process by demonstrating how the Mistborn series came together. \"I was watching the Harry Potter movies and I was thinking about The Lord of the Rings and while I like the idea of the hero's journey, I began thinking about how the dark lord in these stories gets the raw end of the deal. So I wanted to write a book where the dark lord wins. Although that's kind of a downer.\"\r\n\r\nBrandon explained that he shelved that idea until he could figure out how to make a story where the villain wins not be so bleak. \"It took me a little while to figure out what to with that idea. Then I was watching one of my favorite movies, Sneakers, and started thinking about how I hadn't seen an amazing heist story in fantasy ever. Little did I know Scott Lynch was going to release a great one only a year later!\"\r\n\r\nThe two ideas combined, Brandon continued, \"like atoms that combine to create a molecule that's something different.\" The magic system in Mistborn was the same way, according to the author. Allomancy and Feruchemy were magic that had been designed for different worlds but worked really well together with the story of Mistborn.\r\n\r\nSo Brandon set to work, filling out the gaps in the story by brainstorming along the way.\r\n\r\nOne audience member noted that Brandon has a pattern of having his characters working towards a goal only to have that goal turn out to be the incorrect one, which prompted the author to discuss how he thinks of plot twists. \"To figure out a good plot twist you want the reader or viewer to be surprised that it happened and then, as it's happening, realize they should have seen it coming. You can't always pull that off but when you can they're really great and that's what I'm shooting for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't twist my plot just to twist it. My hope is that the more that is revealed, the more that you experience a hidden depth to the characters and their journeys. It's like life. Everyone you meet you make a snap judgment but then the more you get to know them the more depth they reveal. I want readers to experience that with my books. Part of why I like writing epic fantasies is because the story gives you the room to develop and explore that depth. Everything is about more than one thing.\"",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "\"I read a lot of Terry Pratchett. He's a legitimate genius and the books are different enough that I don't have to worry about any unconscious influence on my own writing. Guy Gavriel Kay is the best writer of fantasy today. I frequently read Robin Hobb novels. I love Vernor Vinge.\""

Try to figure out which method works best for you when trying a specific type of story, and perhaps try some hybrids.  Anything that helps you write better stories more regularly is a tool to keep practicing.\r\n\r\nTry a dialogue scene, where you try to evoke character and setting using ONLY dialogue.

      "The signing. The proprietors of Mysterious Galaxy, (a small, very pleasant independent bookseller which specializes in Hard Sci-Fi and SFF) had everyone exit the store to prepare for the signing, as it required setting up two lines. Those who had already purchased a book, and been given a signing line number (Insectoid & Mom were #1 and #2, yours truly was #3) in one line, those who needed to purchase a book for signing in another. As most of you have read regarding other signing events, Brandon gives each person his complete attention for several minutes, having a sincere conversation, while personalizing his signatures. He accepted questions during this time, but limited to one or two per person. When I told him I had a list of questions from the TOR.COM Leigh Butler re-read crowd, he said he'd gladly work with me after the main signing line.\r\n\r\nI would estimate 120-130 folks got between 1 and 5 books signed each. Several brought Warbreaker (myself included), Mistborn or Alcatraz books, and he signed anything of his that was brought, while limiting personalizations.\r\n\r\nAfter the main signing line, he began signing store stock books, as well as doing additional personalizations for the Storm Leaders, who did a terrific job and enjoyed the time as much as any of us. Once he began this, he looked back at me and said, \"Two more questions now, go ahead\". Then periodically as he was working he'd take more.\r\n\r\nDuring this activity, he was handed the store phone several times. It seems he found a moment in all of this to send a tweet, and folks following him on Twitter started calling in because he told them he'd be at the store about another 45 minutes. The first call came from Australia. He spoke like a long-time friend to each of the folks on the phone, and prepared personalizations for them to be delivered.\r\n\r\nOnce everything else settled down, and a few Storm Leaders who hadn't read The Gathering Storm yet had gone, he took a bunch more of my questions. When the shop workers started looking at the clock, he said, \"Let's let these folks close up, I'll step outside with you for a few more minutes to ask the rest of your questions\". We shook hands and he got into the car to take him back to his hotel about 75 minutes after the signing was supposed to end.",

If you didn't register quickly enough to nominate, now is a good time to register so that you'll be eligible to vote on the final ballot, which should open fairly soon. The convention itself will be in Reno, Nevada from August 17th through 21st.\r\n\r\nIf you want more details, read my earlier post. For now, here's a reminder of what I've been involved in that's eligible for a nomination.\r\n\r\nELIGIBLE IN CATEGORY: BEST RELATED WORK\r\n\r\n    Writing Excuses Season Four\r\n\r\nELIGIBLE IN CATEGORY: BEST NOVEL\r\n\r\n    Towers of Midnight\r\n    The Way of Kings\r\n    Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens\r\n\r\nOTHER CATEGORIES\r\nI have a vested interest in a few other possible nominations. My editors Moshe Feder and Harriet McDougal are both eligible in the Best Editor (Long Form) category. Cover artists Michael Whelan, Darrell K. Sweet, and Todd Lockwood are eligible in the Best Professional Artist category. Howard Tayler's Schlock Mercenary book Massively Parallel is eligible in the Best Graphic Story category. Dan Wells' books I Am Not a Serial Killer and Mr. Monster are eligible in the Best Novel category, and Dan himself is eligible for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer (not a Hugo, but nominated on the same ballot).\r\n\r\nIf you're eligible to nominate and haven't done it yet, consider doing it now. And if you've already nominated and happen to want to revise your nominations, you can submit a new ballot that will cancel out the old one, which is rather convenient."

      "Hi, I'm a male writer writing fantasy at the moment with a female perspective character. I'm having trouble with the tone whenever my character bumps up against barriers women have to deal with in my universe. I don't want to beat my audience over the head with gender issues or come off as preachy, especially as I'm still new to writing a female character.\r\n\r\nMy question is, when you were writing your female characters, especially Vin who jumped out at me as a natural but strong female protagonist in a male character dominated genre, did you find her voice came from your previous writing experience, or did you consult much with other authors and/or women you knew? I keep feeling like I should consult some female friends on how I'm writing her, but I don't want to lose my own voice in doing so.\r\n\r\nAlso, I love your novels. I find fantasy is a genre filled with characters who feel like tropes or someone's DnD character, while your characters jump off the page and walk around. If you have any general tips for writing a realistic person, that would be great. If not, just thanks for writing such great people.",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I do consult with others. I think it's vital, particularly when writing 'the other' so to speak. Someone who is different from yourself in some fundamental way.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, every character should be different from yourself in some fundamental way. And, beyond that, there's a trap in thinking \"My character has to think like a woman.\" No, your character has to think like herself. That's an important distinction to make. For every generalization, grouping, or stereotype out there, you can find many, many people who break that mold.\r\n\r\nI actually focus on personality, wants, and needs first. Gender is a part of the character as a concept, and it informs how I write the person�but it is secondary to their passions, goals, and temperament.\r\n\r\nI'd say write the character first, then consult with your female friends. Let them read the character in the context of her story, and get a read on it. So long as the character is strong and individual, you should be fine. Some pointers will undoubtedly help, of course.\r\n\r\nThe best way I've found to make someone realistic is to separate them from the plot and ask yourself who they are, and what they'd be doing, if the plot had never come along and swallowed them up."

      "So what kind of research did I do? When I was in college, one of my favorite things to do was sneak into classes I wasn�t signed up for. And the psychology classes were my favorite. And this friend�this is coincidental�who wanted to be a chef actually got a psychology major. His parents were like �You should do something useful with your life,� so he got a psychology major. He ended up going to med school; he didn�t become a chef. He went to med school and he likes that too. [Note: Brandon talked about this friend during the first part of the signing.] I would sneak into his classes, and they were so useful as a writer. Just to look at the different [neuro]types and to start to see personality not as� We like to look at a lot of things as normal or abnormal, and that�s not the way it is. Everyone�s personality is on a spectrum, and what is normal and what is abnormal is completely a matter of perspective. Where you stand on this line. It�s trying to make a value judgment that shouldn�t really exist. So it�s coming to see personality as these swaths of interesting color is what the psychology classes taught me.",

      "All right. I've had a few weeks to rest after the marathon working of Feb, March, and early April. So, it's time to start thinking about the future. The Gathering Storm is turned in. (Quick answers on two questions: First, I don't know if there will be an electronic copy released. Tor doesn't own electronic rights, these belong to Harriet, and I don't know what she and her agent have decided yet. Second, there should be an audiobook released, very close to the initial release of the hardcover.) With The Gathering Storm done, it's time to look at the projects on my plate.\r\nPROJECT ONE: A MEMORY OF LIGHT PART TWO (The working title is Shifting Winds, which WILL change.)\r\nI've gone ahead and added a progress bar for this one. As I've said before, I've got a large chunk of it written�but that writing needs quite a bit of work. I pulled a lot of the cleanest, finished sections to use in The Gathering Storm. The progress bar says 49% completed, but I'd actually put that closer to 25%, if we look at work to be done and not just raw pagecount.\r\nObviously, Shifting Winds is the most important project for me to finish. It will be getting the largest share of my attention during the next year, and I'm going to do everything in my power to turn it in a little earlier than the previous book, perhaps even allowing for a release earlier next year than November. (I don't know if getting it in early will help that or not, but I'll try.) My self-imposed goal for finishing Winds is November 3rd, so I'll have the rough draft done and turned in before I leave on tour."

BOOM�  It�s a great Michael Bay effect, like it explodes and I drive through the smoke.  It was really awesome I remember it.  And then I was immediately horrified, right?  I�m like �Here I write all these books about people protecting the world with their powers and what would I do if I had them?  I�d be blowing up people because they inconvenience me.�  *laughter*  And this is where the series came from, I thought about that the entire rest of the drive, which was about another hour.  And I thought �What if--  What could we do if people just started manifesting superpowers and--  You couldn�t throw them in prison, or if you did they�d just break out.  You couldn�t defeat them with the armies.  What would the society do if there were legitimately superpowered individuals?�  It�s kind of the same tactic that Watchmen took, if you�ve ever read that, but it kind of goes the other direction with �They are all evil, what do we do?�  That was the origin and I wrote a whole book series about it.",

      "......wooooooooooooooah......\r\nI still can't stop thinking that in my head. It's all that's really coming to mind at the moment.\r\nI made the stupid mistake of finishing the book this afternoon in a public place. Therefore I looked like a complete moron as I burst into tears when Elend died. I think it was a good ending. I'm still not totally decided on that. I'm just in shock.\r\nIt's just so amazing how the books progressed, developing into this huge cosmic epic that I never expected from just reading The Final Empire a year ago. I guess in some sense what I'm feeling is a slight sense of... awe, maybe? I want to know how he comes up with stuff. I mean seriously, talk about not just writing another fantasy series.\r\nBut I'm also shocked that no one else seemed to have figured out that Sazed was the Hero of Ages. I thought it might be him when I started the book, but it could as easily have been Vin or Elend. But at about a third of the way through, page 215 to be exact, there was this line from Sazed thinking in his head:\r\n\"I am, unforunately, in charge.\"\r\nSound familiar?\r\n\"I am, unfortunately, the Hero of Ages.\"\r\nNo one else would have used the same wording as Sazed did when he was thinking to himself. I have to assume that was intentional on Brandon's part. It was very subtle... I'm actually surprised I noticed.",
      "Brandon Sanderson (20 October 2008)",
      "I'm gratified that you noticed. The Terris dialect IS very subtle. That speech pattern is one hint, the other is the use of \"I think\" to soften phrases at the ending. Beyond that, Sazed speaks with compound, complex sentences using frequent hedging to indicate that he's often uncertain. (That's another Terris speech pattern, not wanting to offend with language.)\r\nThe epigraphs in this book particularly (though I did it for Kwaan too) are intended to \"sound\" Terris, and like Sazed in particular. I didn't think anyone would catch it. You made my day!",

It's a tad hard to find, as most bookstores only got one or two copies, but it's out there. If you are a fan of fast paced, humorous adventure fiction, please consider picking up a copy! Really, I think you'll find yourself surprised by how much you enjoy the Alcatraz books. A lot of my epic fantasy readers are hesitant, but there's a lot more going on in these than the covers and/or genre may imply.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you are thinking of getting a copy, might I suggest contacting the bookstore Mysterious Galaxy? I know they have plenty of copies, and I believe they have some signed first editions they are selling for cover price. They're a great store and will be happy to ship you copies of both Alcatraz books. (I suggest calling before ordering to make sure you get a signed copy.)\r\n\r\nNext, Elantris is finally out on Audiobook! You can find it at Audible, Amazon, or the publisher's website. We've been waiting for a long time to get one of my epic fantasy books out on audio, and I know a lot of you have asked about it, so here you go! (And the cover is pretty cool, I must say.)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThird, I'll be signing in the Seattle area the next three days. If you live over in that direction, consider stopping by to see me! We'll have books to sign and I should be doing a reading at several of the signings. (I know I'll be doing one at the University Bookstore.) Most of my readings have been from Mistborn: The Hero of Ages, though sometimes I dip into other projects.

I made a huge mistake though: Obviously I didn't have my copy of The Gathering Storm with me, but I was planning to buy Warbreaker and have BWS sign that. Should have snagged and held a copy; instead I waited until my turn in line only to realize that all the copies were gone. So I picked up a couple of the Alcatraz books and Brandon signed those.\r\n\r\nBy now you should have expected that Brandon would be polite, patient, witty, engaging and an all-around good guy. And he was all of that. I guess what really stands out about him is his consideration for other people.\r\n\r\nAs was the case in San Diego, Brandon agreed to stay late to address the questions but asked that we do it outside the bookstore since they would like to close up. Samadai had gathered the list of questions that you all had requested, and Brandon answered them patiently and thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nI won't steal Samadai's thunder on those answers, but I will give you the answers to the two questions that I asked."

      "In France, your juvenile series Alcatraz has been out for a few months now. Is it some sort of recreation for you, compared to your epic fantasy works?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Yes, it is. I actually wrote Alcatraz between Mistborn books two and three. I had just finished book two, and I wanted to push in and do book three, but I was feeling a little exhausted, almost a little burnt out, and I didn't want to start the final book feeling burnt out. And so, not telling anybody what I was doing, I took some time off, and I wanted to do something very different to encourage myself to grow as an artist, to explore different types of writing. Like I said normally I'm an architect, and I wanted to do a more gardener-type book. For Alcatraz I started with a few premises that I found amusing and interesting and I built a book out of them, as I went. It turned out very well—a lot of my projects that I experiment with, I actually don't publish because they don't turn out very well. I only take the ones that really turn out well and publish them.\r\n    \r\nSo for every Alcatraz, there's two or three other novels that just kind of nose-dived. That doesn't happen with my epic fantasies because I spend so long planning them and getting them ready that I know, before I start, how they're going to turn out.\r\n    \r\nBut anyway, Alcatraz was a light-hearted, fun—but hopefully still interesting and intriguing—story for me to write, about a young man who discovers that librarians secretly rule the world!"

Unfortunately, it looks like the Murray Borders will not get any copies of Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens, but the Bountiful Barnes & Noble already received at least 35 copies. If you plan to come to the Bountiful signing but want to buy the book now, stop by the store and pick it up, then bring it back to the signing. They also have a large number of the previous Alcatraz books and my other titles.\r\n\r\nThis week on the Writing Excuses podcast, Howard Tayler and I are once again joined by Scott Westerfeld to discuss steampunk. And recent Warbreaker annotations talk about Lightsong trying pottery and Vivenna meeting with the slumlords."

So my assistant has put up the first annotation for Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians. This one talks about the process of coming up with the title for the book, with the various (and often ridiculously long) options that were considered.\r\n\r\nIf you're not familiar with my book annotations, think of them as the director's commentary on a special edition DVD. On your second read-through of a book, you may be interested to hear what I have to say about each chapter. Currently I have completed annotations for Elantris, the Mistborn trilogy, and Warbreaker. Check them all out. (Spoilers from later in the book than the current chapter are hidden.)\r\n\r\nMy assistant also uploaded another Twitter posts archive."

      "Readers of Fantasy generally seem to like to lump authors into one of two fields: World Builders and Character writers. This is obviously a very black-and-white definition of the genre, but that being said, which into which side would you place yourself and what are your thoughts on the two in regards to writing a novel?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I think most people would put my writing in the field of the World Builders because many of the comments I receive center on the uniqueness of my magic systems. Honestly, I would rather not be lumped with either side! I try very hard in all of my books to create both interesting worlds and believable characters. If I had to choose just one, however, I would rather be on the side of the character writers because I think characters make better stories than worlds do. In my opinion a good book is a balance between character, setting, and plot with character being the most important of the three. You can have the coolest magic system in the world, but if readers don't care about the characters who are using that magic system, the book won't be very fun to read."

      "I actually have several that I want to do. My schedule's very packed; actually my next YA books are not humor; they're more adventurous. Well, I've got one that's more epic fantasy-ish, and one that's more adventurous. I do want to finish out the Alcatraz series; I actually bought it back from Scholastic, and bringing it to Tor, and then I'm going to finish it off. I also have a book I've wanted to write forever called \"Zeke Harbinger, Destroyer of Worlds\" which is about a young man who, whenever he visits a planet—it's a science fiction—for whatever reason the planet ends up blowing up. It's not really his fault, but there's like a nuclear catastrophe on one, or things like that—don't worry, people are getting evacuated—but whenever goes to a planet it blows up, and that's kind of his...the series is about, you know, each book you visit a planet, and for some reason it ends up exploding. So, you know, I have silly things like that that I want to do. \"Mulholland Homebrew's Sinister Shop of Secret Pets\", a little fantasy story about a girl who accidentally apprentices herself to a guy who runs a fantasy pet shop. You know, stuff like that. Weird things, it's what goes through my head. We'll see if I actually end up writing it.\r\n\r\nPhillip Carroll\r\nWell, that's nice."

      "What changed about you or your approach to writing that helped you cross the threshold from \"dreadful\" to \"passable?\"",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "You know, I would say that there are hundreds of little eureka moments all along the way. Figuring out how to make characters work and not have them be just caricatures. Figuring out how to make a plot twist pop off the page at the end. Figuring out how to make the magic system work. Each of those is a little Eureka moment for me.\r\n\r\nPutting it all together over time and learning how to revise takes effort. Learning to write a book is a lot closer to learning to hit a baseball than people realize. I talk about the process a lot, but that's me analyzing it after the fact. When a batter gets up there to swing at a ball, they've practiced tons and tons and tons. They've gone over fundamentals and learned what those fundamentals need to be. They might think about that for a minute, but when they swing, it all just clicks and they swing at the ball.\r\n\r\nThat's actually what writers do a lot of times when they're writing a story. Yes, they've practiced the fundamentals, and they've written a lot before, but when they sit down to write a story, they just let it flow and the muscle memory takes over. After the fact, you go back and look at it and revise it and try to figure out what you're doing wrong, but there's more instinct to this—instinct born of practice—than people assume."

      "I am curious if professional writers ever get psyched out by their own works. When you are working on an epic series, such as The Stormlight Archive, do you ever have moments of doubt in your ability to see it through to completion? Does it ever feel overwhelming that you have so many volumes ahead of you to write?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "That's not the part that psychs me out. Length doesn't do that to me, particularly when I have a series well planned and I have a feel for how each book is going to be distinctive. This really helped me with the Mistborn series, for instance—when I planned it out, I planned each book to have its own identity. That kept me interested in them.\r\n\r\nNo, what psychs me out is that sometimes something just turns out really well, like The Way of Kings, and then I immediately start thinking, \"I have to do that again, and I don't know how I did it in the first place.\" Writing becomes a very instinctive thing.\r\n\r\nMost of the time when I talk about the process of writing, I'm analyzing what I've done after the fact. The truth of it is that right in the moment, right when you're sitting there working on a book, a lot of that stuff isn't going through your head. You're just running on instinct at that point. So it's easy to get psyched out when you're not sure if you can ever do it again."

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "You know, it's a little bit of both. When I was young—I was 17—I went to my first convention and Katherine Kurtz was there and she sat down with me. And I was just a young, teenage, aspiring writer, and she talked to me for a good half hour on the business, how to write, and other advice. I've remembered that ever since, and I thought if I ever get in this position where I can do the same thing, I want to be available.\r\n\r\nBecoming a writer, so much of it is solitary. You have to spend all this time sitting, writing on your own, and practicing that when you can actually connect with someone who has gone there before, it can mean more than basically anything else in your writing career—save just practicing. So I like to be available.\r\n\r\nI'm at this place in my career where my fans support me. They read the books and that makes it possible for me to do what I do, and I want to be available for them. I use the metaphor that—I guess it's more of a simile—you're like the people in the 19th century. If you wanted to be an artist you had to find a wealthy patron to take care of you. And my wealthy patron is the fandom, right? I exist with them supporting me actively. I mean these sci-fi and fantasy fans are well connected. They can all go pirate the books—they all know how to. But instead they buy them and support me. So I want to be available."

      "Hey, all, there are several things I want to talk about, so I'm just going to attack them in order. (And if you work at Adobe, or know someone who does, make sure you read the last thing on my list.)\r\nWarbreaker\r\nI doubt you need a reminder, but the launch of Warbreaker is only about a week away! Barnes and Noble has kindly decided to put it into one of their big summer promotions, and has ordered a LOT of copies. This is fantastic, since�if you've been reading the blog for a few years�you know that we've consistently had troubles with distribution at Barnes and Noble. Well, they've thrown themselves behind this book a great deal. Finally. So, of course, my natural panic rises that now we won't sell any copies, will prove them right for not supporting the Mistborn books to the extent we wanted, and go back to the old model of never having enough copies out. (Sigh. Sorry, it's hard to not worry about these things.)\r\nAnyway, if you want a numbered/personalized edition, I'm happy to comply�so long as supplies last. But know that if you want to buy the book at your local B&N, Borders, or independent bookseller, I'm going to be touring a great deal over the next two years�so the chances are good I'll be able to get that copy of yours signed.\r\nThere WILL be audio editions; I suspect they'll be out a few weeks after the hardcover. There WILL be an official ebook edition to buy, if you want one�and in order to sweeten that deal, we're probably going to be selling the ebook directly through Tor.com with ALL of the annotations included months, even years, before I get them posted on my website. There should be a special deal of some sort for those who bought the hardcover to get the ebook (with annotations) for a fraction of the regular price, but I'm not sure what it will be. You might have to order both through Tor.com, or maybe there will be a rebate. So if you're thinking of getting both editions to grab the annotations and bonus content, then save your receipt on the hardcover just in case. No promises, but maybe there will be something Tor does to promote.\r\nThe edition in stores does have new scenes that aren't in the edition posted to my website. I will eventually post the pdf to my website of the final edition, though I'm not sure when I'll do that, as I don't want to undercut all of the special effort Tor.com has put into coming up with really nice ebook edition with bonus content. We'll see."

      "I'm working on the final draft of The Way of Kings in order to meet its April 8th deadline, and over the past few days I've posted on Twitter and Facebook breakdowns of how many words I'm cutting from each chapter. This has confused some readers who have asked me not to cut anything out or to save them for an eventual \"writer's cut\" edition. Trust me on this one�the book you'll get on the shelf is the writer's cut, and you wouldn't like the writing as much if I didn't go through and do the trimming on this draft. Sort of like a director shoots a lot of film and then edits it into a coherent narrative later, I tend to overwrite on my first drafts�the language is more wordy than it needs to be, sometimes a character will come to the same realization multiple times as I'm working out where best to fit it in, that sort of thing. In my final draft I go in and trim out all the fat. We talked about this in an episode of Writing Excuses last year; if you're curious about the process, give it a listen.\r\n\r\nSo the words I'm cutting in this draft aren't anything you're going to miss as a reader. Now, sometimes I will cut an entire scene or heavily rework a section, but that usually happens in earlier drafts than this. I do save the cut scenes in case they contain something I want to use somewhere else or just for posterity. In the Library section of the website I've included some deleted scenes from Elantris, Mistborn 1, and Mistborn 2�check those out if you want to understand why it's a good reason those scenes are gone. Long after The Way of Kings is out, some of its cut scenes or early draft sections may end up on that page. We'll see."

      "Did you move a lot of sections around during the development? It certainly seemed as though Kal's parts could go in a different order or start his story from the bottom and work out how he got there.",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Yes, I did move things around a lot, particularly between the first draft of this book in 2003 and this draft. Things have jumped around all over the place, and even at the last minute I was moving different things between parts. Dalinar moved around more than Kaladin did because I was trying to decide where I wanted his ending in part two to happen. I wanted each of the parts to have its own climactic sense, to have a good ending particularly for the characters who didn't continue in the next part, when Dalinar and Shallan were alternating. So there was a lot of juggling and trying to decide—for instance, the prelude was added very late in the process. I'd had the prologue and decided I needed a second prologue as the prologue to the series, which is where the prelude came from.\r\n\r\nKaladin's entire sequence, with the flashbacks and things, was decided on early on, but remember I'd written this book once before. At the end of his flashback sequences, he makes a decision. Where this book deviates from the original I wrote in 2003 is that in the old version he actually made the opposite decision, and it happened in chapter one.\r\n\r\nNow we get to see flashbacks of him making the other decision, which works so much better. It's one of those things where I was beating my head against the wall for years trying to figure out how to make his character work. His character was the part of the original The Way of Kings Prime that had not worked, and it took me years to figure out how to make his character work right. That one decision of his was the turning point."

      "I'm starting a new weekly bonus content feature for the next few months as a bit of an experiment. Right now I'm writing the sequel to The Way of Kings, and I've recorded my writing process for one chapter using Camtasia (which was provided to me by the folks at TechSmith). The chapter I've recorded is the new interlude featuring Rysn (who was in one of the interludes in the first book). I've split the recording up into multiple videos that I'm uploading to YouTube. The first one is up now, and it covers the prewriting/outlining for the chapter. For now, the videos are in real time, but once they're all uploaded I'll make a high-speed version of the whole chapter for those of you who don't want to sit and watch my normal typing speed.\r\n\r\nSome of you are wondering if this video will have spoilers for Stormlight 2. As an interlude, it takes place away from most of the action of the rest of the book, so you shouldn't see more than hints. This first video has the interlude's outline in it, so it will partially spoil the rest of the videos, but you'll find that the outline is very sparse. It's probably more likely to make you more interested to read more than to spoil you for the rest.\r\n\r\nThe main point of these videos is to show you my writing process, which is something I get a lot of questions about. Enjoy. Stormlight 2 should come out before Christmas if I can get the first draft finished in April. I'm working hard on it right now, so we'll see if that happens."

BYU has policies that say �You have to be a BYU student to go to the class� and that�s not something I can influence or change. So as long as I have it at BYU, it kind of has to be that way.

      "How has religion and mythology changed in the 300 years since the events of the Mistborn trilogy?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I had a bit of a challenge in this book because�and you may want to put a spoiler warning on this interview�at the end of the first Mistborn trilogy, one of the characters became the god of this world. He became a god figure, an almost omnipotent figure. I had planned this from the beginning, but it also offers a challenge, because in this world you have a real deity that is interacting, that is a character�not to say that in our world God doesn't interact with us, because as you know I am a faithful, religious person. However, I think there is a different interaction going here where the reader has spent time with this person as a character, and now he is a deity figure. So how to deal with this is one of the big challenges in worldbuilding this next several hundred years.\r\n\r\nI wanted Sazed to be involved�I didn't want to just have him vanish and not be part of things. I wanted to acknowledge what happened with him and make it part of the mythology of the story. But at the same time, having one of your characters turn into God runs you right into the trouble of literal deus ex machina, once one of your characters has all of this power. So walking that line was both exciting and also very challenging.\r\n\r\nI like to deal with religion in my books. I like to look at all aspects of it, and in this book I wanted to look at what it would be like if someone like Sazed had been put in this position and people started worshiping him�what do you do with that?"

      "How did you become interested in being a writer?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "My start as a writer can be traced back to when I was fourteen years old. I was not a very distinguished student, so to speak: Bs and Cs in all my classes. I really didn't have any direction, either; there was nothing I really loved to do. I was also what they call a \"reluctant reader\". My reading skills were not fantastic, so when I tried reading Lord of the Rings for the first time, it was just completely over my head, and I assumed that all fantasy novels were boring. It was a teacher who handed me the very first fantasy novel I ever really finished reading. The book was called Dragonsbane by Barbara Hambly, and it had this gorgeous Michael Whelan cover on it which immediately caught my eye. I read the book and absolutely fell in love with it. I became an avid reader, mostly of fantasy novels, over the next couple of years. Soon I began to think, \"You know, somebody out there is making a living at this, and it seems like it's something that I would really enjoy doing.\" That's when I found some purpose and direction.\r\n\r\nThere were certain influences in my life, my mother primarily, who convinced me that being a writer was hard to do, and she was right. It's one of these jobs where not everybody who tries it actually makes it. She convinced me to go into chemistry during college because I had done well in the sciences all throughout high school, thinking I could write in my spare time and have a real, solid job. It wasn't terrible advice; I'm just not sure it was the right advice for me at that time. I served a mission and during that time I was very, very pleased to be on another continent, away from chemistry. I really missed writing, though, because I'd been doing it for fun all through that freshman year before I left. I actually started my first novel when I was fifteen, but it didn't go anywhere. It was rather derivative and all those things that you expect from the majority of novels written by guys in high school. Knowing I could actually produce something, though, gave me some encouragement. Of course I didn't show it to anybody. I hid it behind the painting in my room because I didn't want anyone to see the pages I'd printed out and make fun of me.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back from my mission, I thought, \"You know what? I'm going to give it a try.\" It sounds kind of stupid, but like I said, there are people that get to do this for a living, and I decided that I was never going to be happy unless I gave it a shot. So I changed my major to English because I assumed that's what you did if you wanted to be a writer. I've since learned that that's not the only way to go about it, but it did work for me. It gave me a much better grounding in the classics. I was able to take some creative writing classes too, as a part of my required credits. I got a job working the graveyard shift at a hotel, which was great for my writing because I was there most weeknights from 11 pm until 7 am, and the only requirements that they put me to were, \"Just don't fall asleep. Do whatever you want, just don't fall asleep. We need you awake in case there's an emergency or if anyone comes in.\" I ended up spending a lot of my time working on novels during those early morning hours, and that's how I was able to pay for school, attend it full-time, and still have time for writing. I did that for about five years until I eventually decided that I would go back for a master's degree. It was sort of a way to delay having to make the inevitable decision of what I was really going to do with my life. My backup career then became working as an English professor, partially because I do enjoy teaching, and I enjoy scholarship on the academic level. My parents were worried about me, though. They were afraid that I was going to end up begging for beans on the side of the road, or whatever it is that starving artists do. At least being able to tell them that I was getting a master's degree was helpful. It was also nice to be part of a community of writers and to be able to see what other people were creating."

It was really me delving into a lot of Shakespeare at the time and seeing the way he pulled reversals and the way he used multiple levels of humor and I wanted to play with that concept in fantasy novels, so a lot of those were planned. Some of them were not, some of them came spontaneously, as you're writing the book, you always come up with great ideas for books while you're working on them so you kind of see the evolution of a few of them. \r\n\r\nWarbreaker is posted for free on my website, the complete draft of it and I actually posted the first draft all the way through to the last draft and so you can actually take and compare the first draft to the very last draft and even the chapters as I wrote them you can see how some things were evolving and coming to be and I was realizing certain things while I was doing it and other things were, were very well foreshadowed from the beginning.",

I'd never been to a sci-fi con before, and Katherine Kurtz was the guest. And I wanted so badly to be a writer, but I knew nothing about any of this. I chatted with her for a good 45 minutes about being a writer. She sat down with me and chatted with me, and it blew my mind. She's a best seller, she was top of her game. And it was so inspiring to me. And later on, Lee Modesitt did the same thing. Robin Hobb did the same thing. When I started coming to the conventions, I would say, \"I want to be a writer. I have no idea what to do.\" And they'd say, \"Sit down, kid.\" And they would start telling me stuff, and I try to regurgitate it on Writing Excuses. The thing to remember, guys, if you listen to the podcast, remember that everything we talk about is a tool you can try. It is not the method, because there is no method. Keep that in mind. But I'm trying to just be part of this. Writing is so solitary that when you can have a community and be part of one and chat with people, it's wonderful."

(Hint to anyone going to a later signing!)\r\n\r\nBehold my new Purple Ajah Theory:\r\n\r\nThe Purple Ajah, or Second Foundation Ajah, is real but not so cohesive as that. It is simply that the Purple Ajah consists of the librarians of the Thirteenth Depository.\r\n\r\nIt all fits, doesn't it? As the librarians, they have more detailed knowledge of the world than anyone else in the entire world, including the rest of the White Tower. By 13th Depository Tower Law, they cannot reveal the existence of the 13th Depository; but nothing stops them from acting on information IN it. So if Verin had been a 13th Depository librarian, she would know things that almost no one else would know—and use that knowledge.\r\n\r\nGranted, most of the contents of the 13th Depository consist of the secret political history of Third Age Randland; but who knows? Secret techniques and prophecies could very well be in there as well.\r\n\r\nWell, there you have it folks: RJ Does Boston."

The Dakhor are a newer development�Wyrn was just getting ready to use them against Elantris when the city fell on its own. (Dilaf wasn't the only Dakhor plant inside Arelon.

When I was writing during this period of my life (some seven years ago now), I was trying to create as many first books as possible. I was sending them all off to publishers, trying to get someone to bite on one of them so I could start a series. However, since I was a nobody, I had to write each book as a stand-alone as well. Publishers, I was told, like to get books from new authors that could stand alone or launch into a series. That way, they're not committing to anything drastic, but can monopolize on popularity if it comes. \r\n\r\nELANTRIS turned out to be one of the best stand-alones I did. I kind of like how it doesn't really need anything more to make it feel complete. And, I've got so many stories that I want to tell, I don't know that I'll be able to get back to this one. I guess it will depend upon how well ELANTRIS sells, and whether or not Tor pushes me toward writing more books in this world. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I've got plenty of things I could talk about if I do come back.",

I'll also be doing a signing on the 22nd at the Koelbel Library in Centennial that's open to all (convention registration not required). This is all before the release of The Gathering Storm, though, so Denver residents should also keep in mind that I'll be back in town on November 1st during the book tour. For details please see my Events page.\r\n\r\nI'm going to be signing and personalizing Sam Weller's Bookstore's copies of The Gathering Storm on October 19th starting at 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time, so if you want to order a copy from them, that is the last moment you can request a personalization. They'll still accept orders after that for the remainder of the signed stock, but you'll be limited to a signature and a number unless you call them before 5:00 on the 19th. For details please see Item #4 on the Release Events page.\r\n\r\nThe limited-edition Mistborn Table of Allomantic Metals art prints have been delivered here to Dragonsteel Entertainment headquarters, and artist Isaac Stewart and I will be signing them tonight. We'll start taking orders probably tomorrow; expect a big announcement here on the blog.\r\n\r\nIn this week's Writing Excuses podcast, Dan, Howard, and I talk with Larry Correia, author of Monster Hunter International, about plot-driven vs. character-driven fiction. Go check it out!\r\n\r\nThe most recentMistborn 3 annotations involve the trilogy's first ball scene in quite a while.

      "Tower Guard",
      "The Bailey�s Crossroads (Washington, DC) Towers of Midnight signing has come and gone, and I think all will agree it was a huge success. An estimated 400 people showed up to get books signed and hear Brandon and Harriet speak. Yet the whole affair was done after less than four hours. Most of this can be attributed to the New Signing System by Brandon Sanderson�, wherein you can bring as many books as you like up the first time, but only one can be personalized. I know Brandon was concerned that this might anger some, but most seemed ok with it, and a few stuck around until the end for extra personalization. And it sure did speed up the process.\r\nOr it�s possible we were just an extra-effective Tower Guard contingent.\r\nWe were definitely an EAGER Tower Guard contingent. I�ll admit that, rather than having one of our members wait for Brandon and Harriet�s arrival as suggested by Jennifer Liang, we may have all waited down there, at one point clogging up the lanes into the store a bit, until an amused Borders employee spread us out.\r\nBad traffic on the roads resulted in a late arrival for Brandon and Harriet, but only by about 15 minutes. In the interests of time, we were quickly ushered into the Borders break room after Harriet warmly greeted a friend of hers who lived in the area and had stopped by to see her.\r\nIn the break room, we were fed sandwiches while Harriet and Brandon pre-signed store copies (for those who wanted signatures but could not stay for the event) as well as copies for the store employees. They graciously answered Tower Guard questions as they signed, about the nature of writing and publication as well as about the series itself. It was a lot of fun, but too brief, as we were already running late to start the signing. To end the pre-festivities, Harriet and Brandon both graciously signed all our Tower Guard shirts, ensuring that mine will probably never get washed.",
      "Harriet McDougal Rigney",
      "The official signing started off with a reading from the prologue by Harriet. Since they had just been in Baltimore the evening before and expected some crossover attendees, they picked a different section to read. Without naming any names and invoking the wrath of the Spoiler God, let�s just say that Baltimore�s reading involved a long-absent evil-doer and ours involved an old-favorite do-gooder. Having Harriet do the reading was a very special event, and I think she charmed the crowd quite well. Her southern accent also lends a certain gravitas to the words as she reads them."

      "I'm a writer. This is what I do. One thing I've noticed�and I'm a big gamer, I enjoy video games�is that a lot of video game people have great ideas. They have excellent storytelling instincts. What they don't have, often, is a lot of practice doing it�you get better at telling stories by telling stories. A lot of the video games out there will have this core of awesomeness but a little bit of roughness around the edges when it comes to dialogue, making sure that the worldbuilding is rigorous, making sure that the characterizations are smooth and have nice arcs. I think that's something I can bring expertise to.\r\n\r\nOne of the nice things about video games is that it's a big collaborative effort. There are certain things that a writer like myself should not be involved in. I don't have any practice coming up with fun ways to play games. I know some writers who assume that because they know how to tell stories, they'll be able to make a game that's interesting, but that's certainly not the case. The developers at ChAIR are experts at making really fun, awesome games. But I can help them with their worldbuilding, making sure it's consistent; with their dialogue, making sure that it's both evocative and interesting without being cliched and overdone. I think that the more people with skill in various areas you have working on a project like this, the better the outcome will be."

      "Warbreaker 6.0 is done! I worked on it a good ten hours today, and managed to push through to the ending. I'm too tired right now to post it, but I'll get it up early next week. The revision took a little longer than I would have wanted�almost three weeks�but it feels very good to have it done and off the plate.\r\nThat leaves only a couple of impending time-stealers from A Memory of Light. I'll need to do draft work on Alcatraz Three sometime in September, though that should be VERY quick. (It's one fifth the size of Warbreaker, and there is a lot less to do on it.) I'll also need to do the copyedit for Warbreaker; that should come sometime in November, and should take me about a week. Other than that, there are two convention visits (Worldcon and Dragon*con) and the book tour in October that will be bumps in the road. However, I'm confident that I can get a good chunk more written before Worldcon even arrives.\r\nNext on the plate is to do a couple solid drafts on the 25% of A Memory of Light which I've finished. I need to get it into a state that Harriet can look at and send it too her as soon as possible, as this chunk threatens to be the one that could need the most revisions. How well she thinks I did on these pages will be a very good barometer of how much draft work I'll have to do on the entire book once it's complete.\r\nHowever, I do intend to divide my time between that revision and�occasionally�dipping into writing some new words. So the percentage bar should start moving again next week, if slowly at first while I spend a lot of time drafting."

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Yeah, yeah, a couple things. First one is, read a lot. Read a lot in the genre you want to be published in. If you want to write short stories, read short stories. If you want to write novels, read novels. Read in the genre, but also read widely. But nothing is more frustrating than someone who says \"I want to publish fantasy novels\" who's never read any. Find out what other people are doing that's exciting and try and add something to it.\r\nThe other thing is, just write. Know that you don't have to be perfect when you start. Nobody sits down and expects to be able to play the piano the first time. But a lot of writers, it seems, get frustrated when they try to write their first book that it's not capturing the vision in their head. So, don't be afraid to be bad at it long enough to get good at it. Just sit down and start writing. Turn off your internal editor. Understand that your first book's not going to be very good and that's just fine. Practice writing it 'cause that's how you learn to write. Do it consistently. Set a time every day or every week where you write. Consistently keep that goal. Work on your books. Don't let yourself write a first chapter, throw it away and write another one, and then throw it away and write another one. Force yourself to finish."

      "The second thing I tried writing was a short story set in the Mistborn world a few hundred years after The Hero of Ages. This one just didn't work; the characters weren't gripping for me. More importantly, it just didn't FEEL like a Mistborn book. I got about one scene into it.\r\n\r\nAs I was working on it, however, I did some worldbuilding on this time period in Scadrial's history. I got to thinking about what was wrong with the short story, and why it didn't feel right. This grew into an outline regarding a completely different story�with no overlap of characters�set in the same time period. I nurtured this and started writing, and it felt right from the get-go. I had the right tone, so I kept writing, expanding my outline, letting the story grow as big as it wanted to be.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I had an 85,000-word novel that I named Mistborn: The Alloy of Law. I'm very excited about the story, and I offered it to Tor for publication with one condition: They had to put it out in 2011. I've mentioned before that I worried I wasn't going to have a book release for you in 2011, what with the extra time A Memory of Light is going to take. Alloy of Law turned out so well that I wanted to share it with everyone, and use it to fill in the gap between Towers of Midnight and A Memory of Light.\r\n\r\nYou may have seen the Tor announcement on this book. It should come out this fall; I'd guess September or October. I want to reassure people that I didn't do this instead of writing the next Stormlight book. This time period between big books had to be used to write something shorter, something more self-contained. I just couldn't have done a Stormlight book. It was this novel or nothing. I'm pleased that Alloy of Law turned out so well."

For me, my creative process is that I�m always searching for the ideas that I can connect into a larger story. I feel that a book is more than just one idea. A good book is a collection of ideas; usually a good idea for each character�something that forms the core of their conflict�several good ideas for the setting: something that�s going to drive the economy, something that�s going to drive (for me the magic) the setting�that sort of thing�and then several good plot ideas. These all bounce around in my head�I�ll grab them randomly. \r\n\r\nAn example of one of these was for Mistborn: For Mistborn, one of the original seeds was, I was watching the Harry Potter movies that had come out, and I was thinking about Lord of the Rings, which I had just reread, and I was thinking, you know, I like the hero�s journey: young, plucky protagonist goes, collects a band of unlikely followers, face the Dark Lord� and I thought �yeah, but those Dark Lords always get, just like, a terrible, raw end of the deal. They�re always beat by some dufusy kid or thing like that,� and I thought �I want to write a book where the Dark Lord wins.�\r\n\r\nBut that was kind of a downer of a book, as I considered it, a little bit, you know, �you read this book, and then at the end the hero loses,� that�s kind of a downer. So I stuck that in the back of my mind saying �I want to do something with that idea, but it�s going to take me a little while to figure out exactly what I want to do with that idea.� And then I was watching one of my favorite movies from a long time ago�both of these ideas come from movies, many of them don�t but these two did�Sneakers, if any of you have seen it, just a, like an amazingly awesome heist story, and I thought �ya� know, I haven�t seen a heist story done in fantasy in forever,� little did I know that Scott Lynch was going to release one, like, one year later [The Lies of Locke Lamora].\r\n\r\nBut nobody had done one, and so I said �I want to do a fantasy heist story.� The two ideas combined together in my head. Alright: world where the Dark Lord won, a hero failed; thousands of years later, a gang of thieves decided to rip the Dark Lord off and kind of try to over thrown him their way, you know, making themselves-- by making themselves rich.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd those ideas combined together. And so a story grows in my mind like little atoms bouncing together and forming a molecule: they�ll stick to each other and make something different. Those two ideas combine to make a better idea, in my opinion, together. And then character ideas I�d been working on stuck to that, and then magic systems I�d actually been working on separately. Allomancy and Feruchemy, two of the magic systems in Mistborn, were actually designed for different worlds, and then I combined them together and they worked really well together, with the metals being a common theme.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did all of that, and when it comes down to write a book I sit down and I put this all on a page, and then I start filling in holes by brainstorming. �What would go well here, what would go well here, I need more here� [accompanying gestures indicate different �here�s�]. And I fill out my outline that way, and I fill out my �World Guide,� as I call it. I actually just got�the wonderful folks of Camtasia (it�s a software that records screens) sent me a copy of their software so that I can record a short story, and I�ll go�I�ll do the outline, and then I�ll do the story, and then I�ll post it on my website and you can see exactly, you know, step-by-step what happens. Just don�t make too much fun of me when I spell things wrong.\r\n\r\nIt�s really weird when you�ve got, like, that screen capture going on, you know people are gonna� be watching this, and you can�t spell a word, and it�s like �I don�t want to go look it up, I can get this right,� it�s like,  the writerly version of the guy who refuses to go get directions. So I like try a word like seventeen different ways, and like �Gehhhh okay,� and then Google tells me in like ten seconds. Anyway, that�s your answer and I hope that works for you. Thanks for asking.",

      "While I was thrilled to hear the excellent, excellent intro to Alloy of Law, I was a little sad that we didn't get to the Q&A part of the session. So I headed over to the Harvard Bookstore, where he would be signing and answering questions. Now, this bit was a little strange for me. I've met Brandon before (probably a dozen times or so between '06 and '09), all at varying levels of fame, I listen to writing excuses every week, and I follow his blag, so it wasn't \"oh my gosh, I get to meet him\" jitters. I feel like, in all the ways that I want to, I already know Brandon.\r\n\r\nThe jitters were probably a combination of a couple of things: (1) I had no desire to have him sign anything, I just wanted to ask Brandon a couple of questions. I've never a big \"sign things\" person, especially when the signer is a person to me, and not a Figure (if that makes any sense). And (2) this was the first time that I had one-on-one interaction with Brandon while considering myself an agent for a higher group (namely, the 17th Shard). It was a bit nerve-wracking in a way that was completely new to me. Anyway, ending my indulgent self-psychoanalysis...\r\n\r\nI figured out the way to overcome (1). Instead of having him personalize it to me, I asked him to write a clue about the Cosmere in my worn copy of Elantris (it's my first Sanderson, and is literally falling apart; the cover is scotch taped on ).",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "He wrote \"Do not go to Shadesmar on this world (really, I'm not kidding)\" on the title page, then said to me \"You guys can chew on that for a little while.\"\r\nI like that. I think that I'll bring in all of my books to his next New York/Boston signing and ask him for Cosmere clues instead of signatures.",

      "You�ve been nominated for and have won several awards, but what kept you going before this kind of affirmation?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "The hardest point for me was when I was trying to break in. I wrote thirteen novels before I sold one.\r\n\r\nNalini Haynes\r\nWow. Congratulations for persevering.\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nI say that to people and sometimes my editors shake their heads and say, �Don�t tell people that; they�ll think that you�re awful.�\r\n\r\nI was not very good at this when I started. I think a lot of authors do that. I�ve come to realise that the thing holding me back for a lot of years was the unwillingness to revise. I was one of those authors who like to write a book, be done with it and move on. Then I would say, �Oh, I�ll write the next one really well.� I liked writing. I really enjoyed that process, but there were some tough years in there, particularly after I started feeling that I was writing things that were really good, that were publishable, that were quite solid and I still kept getting rejections. People kept telling me the books I was writing were too long, I kept sending in these big massive epic fantasies.\r\n\r\n[Nalini pulls her copy of Way of Kings forward.]\r\n\r\nYes. They kept saying these were too big and people aren�t really buying epic fantasy now...this is what the editors were saying.\r\n\r\nNalini Haynes\r\nSo that�s a fashion thing in the industry.\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nYeah. Mm-hm. I don�t know if they were right or not, but that�s what they were saying. So I decided to try writing what I felt the market was doing, and started chasing the market a little bit. I failed at that: I wrote a couple of books that were just awful. That�s the point when I really had my moment of �why am I doing this? What am I doing here?� This was in 2001, maybe early 2002.\r\n\r\nI kind of had to make the decision that I was doing this for me. I was writing books because I loved books; I was doing it because I loved writing. I was going to write the type of book that I wanted to write. I had to decide I didn�t care if I didn�t get published. I decided I would keep writing books until I died, even if I ended up with seventy-five novels unpublished. I actually made that decision.\r\n\r\nThe next book I wrote was The Way of Kings, throwing away all the stuff that people said to me. They tell me my books are too long, and I wrote a book that was twice as long as any book I had written before. They were telling me my books were too expensive, so I wrote one with thirty interior illustrations.\r\n\r\nWhile I was working on Way of Kings I actually sold my sixth book, which was Elantris, one of the ones I had written in the era when I really felt I was doing good work, before I decided to try chasing the market. At that point it was like: �Oh, I just sold one of those!� It actually worked out for me, but it was about eighteen months after I made that decision, that I eventually sold a book in 2003. Since then I�ve had the conviction that I do this because I love it. I haven�t had to have the affirmation to push me along, but it�s great that people do enjoy my books. I certainly wouldn�t be making a living at it if people didn�t enjoy it, but I�d still be writing."

      "The week after my husband's funeral, a friend was staying with me. She'd come down for the service, and she, as so many people are, was both a fan of fantasy and heavily into the net. And she put a printout in front of me�the basic sort of semi-Luddite�and said, you need to read this. And it was the eulogy that Brandon had written and posted on his website. And I read it and thought, gosh, that's just beautiful. And it's also the feeling for my husband's work that I would love to see in whoever takes over to finish the series, because in his last weeks and months, my husband had made it very clear to me that he did want the series finished. I draw a distinction�he had a horror of sharecropping, the endless work of other writers in a world that someone has created. He really had a horror of that, so that's not going to happen. But he really did want the series finished. \r\n\r\nHe began one Saturday night. His cousin�a cousin named Wilson Grooms, who was as close to him as a brother�was visiting. And I had a friend there, thank God, who'd once been a court reporter. And I was scrabbling round in the kitchen making food or something, and Jim . . . who�s read the book? Who's not read the book?  \r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson \r\nThe last one?

My husband, called Jim, began to talk and he said, there's a blank in the blank that nobody knows about, not even Harriet. And he was off and running. And the court reporter was there, fortunately, because I was trying to take notes, and instead I was just staring at him in rapture, kind of. And Wilson went out at midnight and bought a tape recorder, and that was the start of a real outpouring of what he wanted in the rest of the series. That's how I knew he wanted it finished. Otherwise, he'd have kept his mouth shut. Which was not very much in his nature.  \r\n\r\n[laughter]",

[laughter] Any chance we'll get anything there?   \r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson  \r\nYeah, Legion I actually wrote as a television show pitch, was the idea for it . . . pitch a series. And I immediately sold it to Lionsgate. And so, we'll see. It's always hard to say what will happen in Hollywood because there's so much moving there, and to get the pieces in place to make a show or a movie just takes so much work. But I'm hopeful that you will see more there. I am doing more with Alloy of Law. I'll explain that in a minute. Okay?  \r\n\r\nQuestion\r\nThank you.   \r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nYep."

Julian Comstock tied with Palimpsest for fifth place with 62 nominations, so both made it to the final ballot.\r\n\r\nIn the Best Related Work category last year, there were 259 nominations. The top nominee received 56 nominations, and there was again a tie for fifth place, with 29 nominations. (Writing Excuses received eight nominations last year.)\r\n\r\nThe final vote totals exhibit similar differences. 875 ballots were counted for Best Novel, and there was a tie for first with 380 votes for both China Mi�ville's The City & The City and The Windup Girl. 548 ballots were counted for Best Related Work, and This is Me, Jack Vance! won with 251 votes.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample voting breakdown for the final ballot, from last year:\r\n\r\nBest Dramatic Presentation Short Form \r\n\r\nDoctor Who: \"The Waters of Mars\" (winner)\t172\t172\t204\t212\t350\r\nDollhouse: \"Epitaph 1\"\t199\t201\t205\t243\t278\r\nDoctor Who: \"The Next Doctor\"\t144\t144\t173\t203\r\nFlashForward: \"No More Good Days\"\t123\t125\t127\r\nDoctor Who: \"Planet of the Dead\" \t70\t70\r\nNo Award\t59\r\n\r\nThe first column of numbers indicates what people ranked as their #1 choice. 199 people picked \"Epitaph 1\" as their favorite, and only 172 people picked \"The Waters of Mars\" as their favorite. Yet 199 was not above the 50% threshold necessary to win. So the instant runoff began: the lowest vote-getters were eliminated and those voters' preferences reassigned. Of people who voted \"Planet of the Dead\" #1, when that was eliminated, their #2 moved up to #1 and the votes were counted again; four had voted \"Epitaph 1\" as #2 and 32 had voted \"The Waters of Mars\" #2. \"Epitaph 1\" was ahead by a vote, but still didn't have enough to win. This process continued until eventually all but the top two were eliminated, and \"The Waters of Mars\" was declared the winner, even though it was behind in every round but the last.\r\n\r\nYou'll also notice the \"No Award\" listing. If you're voting and think none of the entries on the final ballot deserve your vote, you can pick No Award. I know that No Award won in the Dramatic Presentation category in 1977, but this is rare. There are more details on the Hugo voting system here."

      "The summary:\r\n\r\nThere are no heroes.\r\n\r\nEvery single person who manifested powers�we call them Epics�turned out to be evil.\r\n\r\nHere, in the city once known as Chicago, an extraordinarily powerful Epic declared himself Emperor. Steelheart has the strength of ten men and can control the elements. It is said no bullet can harm him, no sword can split his skin, no explosion can burn him. He is invincible.\r\n\r\nIt has been ten years. We live our lives as best we can. Nobody fights back . . . nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans who spend their lives studying powerful Epics, finding their weaknesses, then assassinating them.\r\n\r\nMy name is David Charleston. I'm not one of the Reckoners, but I intend to join them. I have something they need. Something precious, something incredible. Not an object, but an experience. I know his secret.\r\n\r\nI've seen Steelheart bleed.",

      "That's an excellent question. This is a somewhat crowded genre recently. Of course, dystopian fiction has always been popular in the SF/fantasy field, but lately it's had quite a boom. I am the only one that I know of doing a superhero apocalypse. I wrote the book because one day I was driving down the road and someone cut me off in traffic, and I thought, \"It's a good thing I'm not a supervillain, because I would totally blow up your car.\" The what-if for me on that was—what if someone could just blow up your car if you cut them off in traffic? How would that change the world? What would we do if people started getting super powers and just started taking whatever they wanted? Would we be able to stop them? What would happen if the government just declared them forces of nature, acts of God, something that can't be changed. It was an interesting enough premise that I wrote a book based around it, and that's where Steelheart came from. It's a premise that I haven't seen done before."

      "You also run the Writing Excuses podcast with Howard Tayler and Dan Wells; did the idea start with you, or was it the brainchild of a get-together? And why do you think it has become so popular?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "A couple years ago, I realized that there�s a whole lot of writing talent hanging around my area. I also realized that my brother is getting a degree that focuses heavily on web marketing, and that he had just taken a podcasting class. These two ideas started battling to the death in the arena of my mind, until they merged into the weekly podcast known as Writing Excuses. Dan Wells and I have been friends since college, and before we were published we went to conventions together to hit up editors. (His first published book, horror novel I Am Not a Serial Killer, recently came out in the UK.) Howard I met more recently, but I�d long been a fan of his Schlock Mercenary webcomic (schlockmercenary.com). I felt that our combination of writing styles and backgrounds would make an interesting mix for the podcast, and Dan and Howard were enthusiastic. As for why the podcast has become popular, I think our slogan has a lot to do with it��Fifteen minutes long, because you�re in a hurry, and we�re not that smart.� Our goal is to be quick, informative, and conversational�and, if possible, occasionally amusing. That has clearly struck a chord with our listeners."

      "Last year I was an instructor at the first Superstars Writing Seminar with David Farland, Kevin J. Anderson, Eric Flint, and Rebecca Moesta. Well, it's happening again this January in Salt Lake City, with additional special guest instructor Sherrilyn Kenyon. I mention it now because the tuition rates go up at the end of October. This conference focuses on the business of writing, and I had a blast at last year's event in Pasadena. Here's how I described it last year:\r\nSo many people ask me for writing advice and help with their work that I decided to say yes to this invitation because it will give people the chance they've been asking for. I realize the seminar is expensive�which means it's not for everyone�but as busy as I'm getting nowadays, something like this seems the only way.\r\nThe other writers participating could all still teach even me a thing or two. In fact, Dave specifically did teach me a lot about the writing business�it was while taking a writing class from him close to ten years ago that I finally began to understand what it takes to make it in publishing. And Kevin gave me invaluable advice that has made my life as a writer much easier over the past year. If you read the testimonials in the sidebar on the site you'll see names of pro writers whose work I've mentioned before or who we've had as guests on Writing Excuses, including Eric James Stone, Brandon Mull, John Brown, and Bob Defendi�all of them have benefited extremely from classes taught by Dave and/or Kevin & Rebecca. The instructor talent lineup for this seminar is daunting even to me, and I'm one of them!\r\nThis year's conference will cover topics such as:\r\n\r\n    * Economics of Commercial Publishing\r\n    * How Editors Look at Manuscripts, Novels, and Short Fiction\r\n    * Dissecting a Book Contract\r\n    * How to Read and Understand a Royalty Statement\r\n    * Dirty Secrets: What You Need to Know About Being a Professional Author\r\n    * How to Leverage Your Intellectual Property\r\n    * Balancing Acts: Writing World and Real World\r\n    * Agents\r\n    * Networking and Self-Promotion for Authors\r\n    * Understanding E-Books\r\n    * Pitching the Big Proposal\r\n    * Two Heads Are Better than One: Collaborations\r\n    * How to Get an Edge with New Media\r\n    * Movies, TV, and Authors\r\n    * How to Increase Your Writing Productivity\r\n    * and more, including open Q&A sessions, a special limited-seating VIP banquet to get to know the instructors, and plenty of networking opportunities among the teachers, other writers, and fellow students.\r\nIf this is the sort of thing you're interested in, now's the best time to register."

Plus, it felt natural, since it was a problem with Kelsier's own growing reputation. The very thing he's been working so hard to foster eventually turned against him.\r\n\r\nWhen alpha readers read this chapter, they didn't see the loss of the army as much of a setback. That was one of the first things that made me realize the big flaw in the early drafts. I'd talked a lot in the crew about stealing the atium, but I'd spent all the time with them actually doing things on recruiting the army. So, the readers were still focused on the job being the atium heist, rather than the capture of the city. In that context, losing the army isn't all that bad.\r\n\r\nSo, I like how the rewrite focuses much more on the army. It makes the events of this chapter all the more poignant.

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "It�s true, but I always make sure that it isn�t just about the stereotype. It�s a fun thing to challenge some of the classic fantasy models, but that shouldn�t take over the writing as that can really undermine a writer. Piers Anthony was an example where the puns were fun but eventually came to undermine the series. I like having non-stereotypical professions and I enjoyed challenging age perceptions in Way of Kings. Having a romance between a man in his 50s and a woman in her late 40s is unusual in fantasy, where it�s all about the young man falling in love."

      "What advice would you give to aspiring authors?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Practice. Don't worry about anything other than finding time to write—then spend that time on your stories. Publishing shouldn't worry you; nothing should. Just practice.\r\n\r\nHenry L. Herz\r\nIndeed, I cannot underscore enough the value of belonging to a good critique group. I would also offer up Brandon's Laws (again from Wikipedia):\r\n\r\n\"Sanderson's First Law is that \"An author's ability to solve conflict satisfactorily with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic.\" While originally created as a rule for magic systems in fantasy novels, Sanderson has specified that this law need not apply just to fantasy, but is also applicable to science fiction. This Law was originally defined in Sanderson's online essay \"Sanderson's First Law\". In the essay he qualifies the two extremes of design as being:\r\n\r\n1. Magic/technology has well defined rules that the audience understands. As a result, one can use this to solve conflict more easily as the capabilities are cleanly defined. Sanderson classifies this as \"Hard Magic\". C.L. Wilson in her essay \"Worldbuilding 101 — Making Magic\" advocated this method of creation, stating, \". . . create your rules, then follow them.\"\r\n\r\n2. Magic/technology has unclear or vague rules, or none at all. This allows for a greater sense of wonder to be attained for the reader, but the ability to solve problems without resorting to deus ex machina decreases. Sanderson classifies this as \"Soft Magic\". Lawrence Watt-Evans specifically advised \"The trick is to be a benevolent and consistent deity, not one who pulls miracles out of a hat as needed.\"\r\n\r\nSanderson's Second Law is \"Limitations > Powers\", that a character's weaknesses are more interesting than his or her abilities. It was initially set down in Episode 14 of the podcast Writing Excuses. John Brown, likewise looked to Sanderson's work in his own essay involving magic systems, noting \"What are the ramifications and conflicts of using it?\" Patricia Wrede likewise noted several issues on this topic ranging from magic suppressing other technologies, to how a magic might affect farming. In explaining the second law, Sanderson references the magic system of Superman, claiming that Superman's powers are not what make him interesting, but his limits, specifically his vulnerability to kryptonite and the code of ethics he received from his parents.\r\n\r\nSanderson's Third Law is that a writer should \"Expand what you already have before you add something new.\"\r\n\r\nSanderson's Last Law is that a good magic system should be interconnected with the world around it. Sanderson points out that magic does not take place in a vacuum. It is related to the ecology, religion, economics, warfare, and politics of the world it inhabits. The job of the author is to think farther than the reader about the ramifications of the magic system. If magic can turn mud into diamonds, that has an effect on the value of diamonds. Sanderson states that readers of genre fiction are interested not just in the magic system but how the world and characters will be different because of the magic.\""

      "I know you're past this now, but would you ever consider something like the Patreon? Is that something that you would've done ten years ago, if it existed?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Yeah, I might have... Patreon is kind of a hard thing, because I think Patreon is much better for people who are doing something that may be not as market-friendly, but which a group thinks is very important and should be rewarded. There are certain authors I know whose work is very important to the field, like Nora Jemison. Nora's work is really important, and it's really good, but... and it's sold pretty well, but I think that the idea of \"(???) have to be market-friendly\" is really terrifying to Nora... maybe not terrifying, I don't think anything terrifies Nora. But you know, it's that she doesn't want to be beholden to that, and so her setting up a Patreon said, \"look, I'm just gonna write this stuff, I don't even have to worry about the market\", is really good use of Patreon. We set one up for Writing Excuses, and then we use the money to pay our guests, and to fly people in and stuff like that. I don't need one because what I write naturally does very well in the market and so there's no need or worry for me to do that. If all writing shifted in that direction I'd be fine with it, but for right now what's working here with me is working just fine...\r\nQuestion\r\nYeah, the traditional model for publishing really serves you...\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nYeah. The traditional model works very well when you're someone like me. My plots and my stories and things just connect very well with a large segment of the population. (pauses) It's also why I don't do a lot on Kickstarter, like I think Kickstarter's- like we did, we let people making this one board game - which, by the way, Mistborn Board Game, yeah, you guys kickstarted that very well - I let them Kickstart that, they're like a small company that makes the board game, and I said, \"you can make the board game, but you have to get a really good designer, because I can't micromanage making a board game\", and so they get it, and that's somebody very expensive, and then they Kickstarted, you guys supported that. I think that's a good use of Kickstarter for someone like me, but Kickstarter ain't just something of my own, I'd rather Kickstarter be used by people who maybe need it a bit more, so I've stayed away from doing this thing for now."

      "One thing I really liked on your books is that you�ve reinvented a lot of fantasy tropes in a lot of good ways. But you also are inspired by some literary works, you�ve mentioned Les Miserables, which is a fantastic novel. So I was just wondering if what advice would you have for people in terms of speculative fiction and literary works?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Well, advice for drawing. We did a writing excuses podcast on this, so you can go look up those, �How to be influenced consciously.� But boy. Read good stuff, and start to think about why it�s good. It�s going to help you. I don�t know if I can specifically tell you anything other than that, but read it, decide what �s working for you, and try to use that, try to feel. But remember to feel what they did, not what they did. Meaning, here�s a good example. You read Tolkein. You say �Wow�. What Tolkein did wasn�t creating Elves and Dwarves. What Tolkein did was create an interesting mythology that was well interconnected. And a lot of people will say well, I want to learn from Tolkein, so I will use what he did, and they don�t dig that level deeper. They say �Well, I�m going to use the elves and dwarves.� They don�t say �What is it that he did the level down that really made this work?� And that�s what you should be emulating. So when you read the classics, say �What�s making it work?� Try to dig the level deeper if that makes sense.",

      "I am curious if professional writers ever get psyched out by their own works. When you are working on an epic series, such as 'The Stormlight Archive', do you ever have moments of doubt in your ability to see it through to completion? Does it ever feel overwhelming that you have so many volumes ahead of you to write?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "That's not the part that psychs me out. Length doesn't do that to me, particularly when I have a series well planned and I have a feel for how each book is going to be distinctive. This really helped me with the Mistborn series, for instance-when I planned it out, I planned each book to have its own identity. That kept me interested in them.\r\n\r\nNo, what psychs me out is that sometimes something just turns out really well, like The Way of Kings, and then I immediately start thinking, \"I have to do that again, and I don't know how I did it in the first place.\" Writing becomes a very instinctive thing.\r\n\r\nMost of the time when I talk about the process of writing, I'm analyzing what I've done after the fact. The truth of it is that right in the moment, right when you're sitting there working on a book, a lot of that stuff isn't going through your head. You're just running on instinct at that point. So it's easy to get psyched out when you're not sure if you can ever do it again."

      "We�ve heard from the Stormfather, who is a completely unreliable witness, and Syl, who doesn�t even remember, that it was men�s fault.  Pattern is certain that Shallan will choose to kill him in the future, but I don�t remember him saying the Radiants were �wicked.�  That doesn�t really fit with what we know of cryptics anyway.  He went dormant when Shallan ignored him, but why would he think she would go even further and �kill� him when his standards are much different than honorspren?  Also, the big troop of Radiants who abandoned their swords in Dalinar�s vision all did it at once.  Their swords and armor were glowing and functioning when they arrived, so not oathbroken yet, and they do it in mass right then.  Why would they choose that?  (And weren�t many of them Windrunners?)\r\n\r\nI think the Listener verse about the Parshendi being milk to the spren as opposed to the meat provided by bonds to men hints at the answer.  We know that the spren imitated what the heralds could do and initiated the bonds on their own. I think that there is a cost to the Nahel bond that is undisclosed�the spren are somehow feeding/draining something�life, magic, etc. from their partners.  They have good intentions and/or view short human live through a different lens of priorities in perspective of the millenia long struggle with Odium, but the humans pay a steep cost in exchange for their increased abilities.  Maybe they eventually drain and become spren themselves?"

      "One of the big time eaters lately has been the Warbreaker Copy Edit.  This is the last chance that I, as a writer, get to look at and change a manuscript before it goes to press.  After this, the text is locked into place, and it's very difficult to make changes other than little proofreading tweaks.  So I like to take my time on a copyedit and make sure everything is how I want it.  I also take a lot of notes during this point for the Annotations, as this is generally my last time reading straight through a book. \r\n\r\nThe copyedit arrives in a loose leaf form, having already been to a copyeditor.  Their job is to do very in-depth line edit, meaning they're not editing for story or character, but instead trying to make sure everything is consistent, properly formatted, and grammatically correct.  One of the big things I have to do in a copy edit is approve or reject any changes made by the copyeditor.  (Of course, there are rarely things to reject here�but occasionally you do something for stylistic purposes that might not be standard.  For instance, in Warbreaker, I wanted to have Kalad's Phantoms capitalized, despite the fact that the copyeditor wanted to make the Phantoms lower case.)"

      "History and Use\r\n\r\nAon Omi is best known as the official symbol of the Korathi church in Arelon. It was chosen by Korath (known as KoWho in JinDo) himself to represent the church and God. Scholars of the time say that Korath made the decision late in his life, after decades spent preaching his interpretations of the tenets of Shu-Keseg (which eventually became the Korathi religion) in Arelon and Elantris itself.\r\n\r\nThe choice was shocking to many, as the young Korathi devout saw the Elantrians and their worship as a competing religion. Their Aons, the basis for Elantrian magic an power, were then regarded as heathen symbols. Korath was always bothered by this competitive streak in his believers, and it is widely accepted that he picked an Aon to represent God and his religion as an attempt to show that all people were acceptable beneath the blanket of the Korathi doctrines. He himself called the Aon a \"Thing of Beauty\" and asked an Elantrian smith of his acquaintance to craft a silver pendant for him bearing the symbol.\r\n\r\nThat event, and the subsequent adoption of Aon Omi by the Korathi church, led to the odd relationship between the Elantrians and the Korathi religion which took root in their homeland. (Though, following Korath's death, his right-hand man and follower ShanVen moved the religion's center of operations to Teod instead, where the young monarchy there had embraced Shu-Korath as its official religion.)\r\n\r\nOver the years, many other Aons have been adopted by the Korathi religion, but this one�Aon Omi�has remained their most powerful and important symbol. It is used extensively in Korathi religious services, and pendants bearing Aon Omi are commonly worn by the devout. (Many simply call them Korathi pendants, or Korathi religious pendants.) Such pendants are commonly exchanged during Korathi wedding services. (See the end of ELANTRIS the novel for an example.)\r\n\r\nMany Korathi priests now look at the use of Aons by their religion as a symbol of the potential unity of all mankind, when different beliefs, sects, and cultures will be drawn together through sincere affection for one another.",

      "2013 has been one helluva year for Brandon Sanderson—he recently took home his first two Hugo Awards (for the novella The Emperor's Soul and the podcast Writing Excuses) and he released his first young adult work The Rithmatist to critical acclaim—but it's about to get exponentially better.\r\n\r\nReading Sanderson's latest release, a blockbuster of a thriller entitled Steelheart (out September 24), will have fans of superhero fantasy feeling like they've stumbled into their own Herbal Essences commercial (\"Yes, yes, yes!\"). It's a mind-blowing experience—easily one of the most satisfying novels I've read all year.\r\n\r\nSet in a near future where the appearance of a bright red star in the sky (known as Calamity) has given some ordinary people extraordinary powers, this novel—which is the first installment of his Reckoners series—is nothing short of a masterwork.\r\n\r\nThe story is kick ass—it's breakneck paced and action packed. Subtle foreshadowing and allegory abound. The chapters are relatively short and all end with cliffhangers. As the story progresses, Sanderson begins revealing jaw-dropping plot twists. Everything comes together in a climax that will have readers not only standing up and applauding but instantly agonizing because they now have to wait a year until the next novel (Firefight) is released.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Steelheart is an absolute must-read for anyone who is a fan of superhero fiction. And while it's marketed as a young adult read (ages 12 and up), it's not really so much a young adult novel as a novel that can be read and enjoyed by young adults.\r\n\r\nThe following exclusive interview with Sanderson is transcribed from audio that he recorded specifically for the Barnes & Noble Blog.",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "That's very cool to hear! Approaching this book was in some ways very difficult for me because I have read superhero prose, and it usually doesn't work. I came to it with some trepidation, asking myself, \"Is this really something you want to try?\" A lot of the superhero tropes from comic books work very well in their medium and then don't translate well to prose. So for my model I actually went to the recent superhero films. Great movies like The Dark Knight or The Avengers have been keeping some of the tropes that work really well narratively. Tropes that feel like they're too much part of tradition—like putting Wolverine in yellow spandex—work wonderfully in the comics. I love them there! But they don't translate really well to another medium.\r\n\r\nI think part of the problem with superhero fiction is that it tries to be too meta. It tries very hard to poke fun at these tropes, trying to carry them over into fiction, and it ends up just being kind of a mess. But the genre has translated wonderfully well to film through adaptation. So when I approached Steelheart, I actually didn't tell myself, \"I'm writing a superhero book.\" In fact, I've stayed very far away from that mentally and said, \"I am writing an action-adventure suspense-thriller.\" I use some of the seeds from stories that I've loved to read, but really, Steelheart is an action thriller. I used that guide more than I used the superhero guide. I felt that adaption would be stronger for what I was doing. Comic books have done amazing things, but I felt this was what was right for this book.\r\n\r\nAs for the original seed that made me want to write this story, I was on book tour, driving a rental car up the East Coast when someone aggressively cut me off in traffic. I got very annoyed at this person, which is not something I normally do. I'm usually pretty easygoing, but this time I thought to myself, \"Well, random person, it's a good thing I don't have super powers—because if I did, I'd totally blow your car off the road.\" Then I thought: \"That's horrifying that I would even think of doing that to a random stranger!\" Any time that I get horrified like that makes me realize that there's a story there somewhere. So I spent the rest of the drive thinking about what would really happen if I had super powers. Would I go out and be a hero, or would I just start doing whatever I wanted to? Would it be a good thing or a bad thing?"

      "We've gone far more realistic these days in fantasy art than Darrell's style was complimentary toward. However, when I first got into fantasy books, the covers were not like what we had today. The genre was still in its infancy, and fantasy illustration was equally youthful. Publishers were still trying to figure out how to illustrate it. We usually either got conceptual covers like the sf ones you can find on this thread or, far worse, the dreaded woman in a chain mail bikini—a trope I consider downright stupid in a genre almost universally populated with strong female protagonists.\r\n\r\n(Note that I don't intend this as a dismissal of Frazetta or Vallejo. Though I wouldn't consider myself a fan of that style, often their art was on the right books. A Conan cover SHOULD have art like that. However, this style (as seen in this link) was even prevalent on things like the Pern books, where it didn't belong.)\r\n\r\nFor more research, look through this whole archive of fantasy and sf covers, many from that era. That was the sort of thing we were dealing with. Grim, dour, oiled up, or silly was the norm. With that in mind, compare what Darrell brought to us."

That was a lovely thing he did.\r\n\r\nIrene Gallo \r\nIt is. He did a good job. The palette and compostion really works with the other covers. I didn't envy him the job and he turned it into a nice tribute as well as a conclusion.\r\n\r\nHarriet McDougal \r\nAnd Sam Weber is so nice. I keep trying to call him Sam Weller because of Dickens. He said Whelan called him once and asked: \"What's a ter'angreal?\"\r\n\r\nLooking at The Way of Kings, I had an extraordinary coincidence. A friend of mine's former wife is a curator at the Phillips Collection in Washington. She's a descendent of John Martin, an English painter also known as Mad Martin. He was the highest paid artist in Great Britain in the 1840's, and then he sank into total obscurity until a couple of war refugees rediscovered and resurrected his works after World War II. One of his paintings is the cover of The Way of Kings, except that there's a big pantheon where the guy is in the distance.\r\n\r\nIrene Gallo \r\nI'm going to look that up.\r\n\r\nHarriet McDougal \r\nHis skies are very much like Michael Whelan's. He was doing all that stuff way back then. I don't know if Whelan's ever looked at him, but it looks as if he has. Those fabulous skies of Whelan's."

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "That's an enormous question. Listen to Writing Excuses, I'll talk about that later. What started me? I was kind of a lost boy in school in middle school. I didn't do bad, I got Bs and Cs. I didn't have passion about anything, I was just kind of wandering. And then, I discovered fantasy novels. And it's dumb to say, but fantasy novels changed my life. I don't know why. Now, as a 37-year-old, I can look back and say \"Well, obviously, it was THIS\" But I don't know what it was. I discovered specifically Dragonsbane, the works of Anne McCaffrey, and the works of Melanie Rawn. Which were right after one another in the card catalog, and they all three had Michael Whelan covers. And I don't know why, but those three things grabbed me, and then I realized this is what I wanted to do. I realized this is a job people do, and it's awesome. So I told my Mom, and she said \"Well, you better get better grades, then.\" That's what my Mom does, she's an accountant. And I got straight As in 9th grade. I did. Because I'm like, I now know why I'm doing this, and I have to be literate if I'm going to be an author. So it's hokey to say \"Fantasy novels saved my life\". They didn't save my life, but they sure changed my life."

      "How do I get you to write one book in the Stormlight Archive every year?\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson \r\nIs this the part where I get in trouble for not having the second book in to you yet? I keep promising it, and I'm usually very good at meeting my promises on deadlines, but I'm touring so much this year. I've had to tell the fans, \"I have to support the books that are out there, and you all want to see me, and you all invite me to conventions.\" I have to learn how to manage that better, because since January, I've basically only been home for about two months. I'm out there all the time, all over the place.\r\n\r\nIt's tough. I have to write. I had to write 3,000 words on the plane yesterday, and writing on the plane is not easy, but I'm going to have to write a big chunk of this book on this tour. Grit my teeth and go.\r\n\r\nTom Doherty \r\nI don't want to wait myself.\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson \r\nI'm trying. I'm trying, Tom. If I finish this one in the next couple of months, it will have been one year since I started writing it. That makes it more reasonable that we'll get them every year. I really think every 18 months is more likely, but I don't want the readers to have to wait. You know, as much as I respect the guy, I don't want to do a George R. R. Martin thing to people, where it's four years between books. That's just too long to keep all these characters for a big epic fantasy in mind.\r\n\r\nTom Doherty \r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson \r\nSo hopefully, one every year, two every three years, will continue to be my goal for this series.\r\n\r\nTom Doherty \r\nBeautiful. Do you expect any crossover between worlds ever at any time?\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson \r\nOh yes, definitely. In fact, if fans go read right now, there's crossover.\r\n\r\nTom Doherty \r\nThere is?\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson \r\nOne of the characters from Elantris is in The Way of Kings, just in one chapter. And one of the characters from Mistborn is in The Way of Kings. There is crossover. It's never going to be the forefront of the series. I don't want you to have to have read Mistborn to enjoy the Stormlight Archive, but if you have, and you really want to get into these things, you can find all the clues connecting all the worlds. It's a story hidden behind the story. Someday I'll write its own dedicated series for it. But again, it's important for me that I make sure that fans don't have to have read my entire breadth of work in order to enjoy a given series. It has to stand on its own.\r\n\r\nTom Doherty \r\nWell, I think we've got something special going. It isn't often I can't wait for the next book. I've got too much to read.\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nWell, thanks Tom. That makes me feel pretty awesome."

      "The biggest piece of advice I would give them is: You just gotta finish stuff. A lot of people want to be writers. And a lot of people have really great ideas. And get their great ideas together and say, \"Wow! I think this could be a book.\" Then they start on it and for various reasons, they stop. One of the main reasons is they get discouraged because it's not turning out as they want it to turn out, or they get distracted by another really great idea they've just had, or they want to go back and keep revising this initial stuff that they've written. And you've got to finish. You won't understand how to be a writer until you actually finish a book. And you've got to remember that nobody starts off being perfect. And it's that process of writing books that aren't so good that teaches you how to write books that are good. No one expects to sit down and play the piano perfectly the first time. Yet a lot of people sit down and try to write the perfect book the first time. So, my biggest piece of advice to them is: Sit down, write, finish a book. And that will teach you how to write a good book.\r\n\r\nMatthew Peterson\r\nAh. That's some good advice."

I'm starting on A Memory of Light on January 1, but I've got these three months to do whatever occurs to me. Two months ago, I wrote a story about a pizza delivery man who turns into a necromancer.

At one point some time after 10 pm we were told that the last person was in line and we were in the home stretch. As time went by I kept looking over at the line to the side where it wrapped through the bookshelves. I kept hoping for some sign that we were nearing the end. Finally I saw it, the end of the line. My girlfriend was at home watching us on ustream and sent me a text wondering why we were all suddenly looking behind us. It was amusing how everything stopped or that one moment as we all realized the end was in sight. At the same time though was a touch of sadness at knowing that this great night was coming to an end. Finally shortly before midnight, almost five hours after the official start of the signing, the last person in line stepped up to the table, greeted by a round of applause. We got our stuff packed up, and the Tower Guard finally got to get their books signed. Brandon tried to skip numbering mine as a test, but I caught it one last time."

      "Do you have any advice for any young writers out there who are trying to follow in your footsteps?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Yeah. The reason I wrote so many books before I got published was not because I was a terrible writer, though at the beginning I was. It was because I loved writing, and I didn't want to stop writing to go do all this marketing stuff. And I think that actually helped me, because I got to spend a lot of time playing with my style and deciding what my impact on the genre would be. And it also taught me that even if I never got published, I would keep doing this for the rest of my life. I'd be writing a book every year. No matter what job I ended up in, that was just what I was going to do.\r\n\r\nAnd so, if you don't love writing to that extent, it's going to be much harder for you to break in. And so I say, build good habits, write what you love. And make sure that you enjoy the process. Enjoy the busy work parts of it. I went to school freshman year as a chemist. I only changed to English when my sophomore year began. And one of the reasons I made the change is that the busy work part of chemistry, I didn't enjoy. While the busy work part of writing, I loved. So, love it. And then keep at it. Don't give up, just keep going."

      "Before the Ascension, why did the mists appear just as the Well was gaining power? Did they come out at other times?",
      "Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)",
      "This one is trickier. From what I got out of it, it's because the mists are a manifestaion of Preservation, and physical manifestations of Preservation (including Allomancers) are intended to do two things - stop Ruin, and protect the Well of Ascension. Which are kind of the same thing. So, when the Well was dormant, the mists didn't really have much to do. The Deepness form of the mists is a result of the conscious part of Preservation freaking out and trying to produce a way to protect the well, mostly by producing more Allomancers. That's why the mists do all the funky things in the Well of Ascension and Hero of Ages - they're trying to produce more Allomancers to combat Ruin.",

      "Sadly, no one dressed up. Sanderson did get a few gifts. A fan from Wales had brought along a Dalek keyring. One fan had written his name down on a piece of paper, gave it to his sister who gave it to Sanderson to hopefully use in a future book. One had written a letter to Sanderson, which he would read later.\r\n\r\nOnce all fans had been and gone, a few hung back. While getting his books signed, one fan, Matt, had brought his Magic: The Gathering cards along with him and mentioned this to Brandon Sanderson, who admitted that they might play at the end of the signing if time allowed. Matt returned, and both Sanderson and Matt played a quick game in the store. From what I gathered (as I don't know much about the game), Matt seemed to make a good start, then Sanderson pulled out an ace card and Matt lost in three moves! Matt didn't seem to mind—I think the experience of playing a game with Sanderson was far more important!"

So we're a bit behind on updates.\r\n\r\nThe most recent Mistborn 3 annotations cover Allomantic secrets including atium Mistings and the kandra coup and Sazed's decision.

First up is a talk with Isaac Stewart, interior artist for the Mistborn books and one of the artists for The Way of Kings, about the visual elements of storytelling. Next up is breaking the fourth wall, again with Isaac (who is also half of the team behind the webcomic Rocket Road Trip with Warbreaker map artist Shawn Boyles). And finally is Living with the Artist which features Sandra Tayler, Dawn Wells, and Kenny Pike talking about what roles they play in their spouses' careers, among other things.

      "Yeah, yeah, I got it. Brandon, thank you. So if someone is in high school or college, a person in their teens or twenties, and they think they might want to be a writer but they don't know how to begin or are concerned about the effort, you know, any of the concerns people have, what is your guidance?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Number one, and most important, is just to keep doing it. Make good habits. Set aside a time, at least once a week, where you can spend some time writing and working on your craft. And don't worry about publishing. In fact, don't be afraid of being bad at it. A lot of people who begin writing, they assume because they've been taught writing, how to write, the actual physical mechanics of it, that storytelling will come to them naturally. And it will over time, but it's as hard to learn as maybe learning to play the piano or something like this. And most people don't expect to sit down and play the piano beautifully their first try. And in the same way, most people who sit down to write books aren't great their first try. So just remember to learn to fall in love with the process. I do have a podcast about writing. It's called Writing Excuses. You can go there and listen in, I've got some advice there. You can find that also linked through my website, brandonsanderson.com.\r\n\r\nAnd Warbreaker, which we talked about, actually I released into the creative commons. When I published the hardcover, I released an electronic copy for free. So you can go to my website and actually download the PDF of Warbreaker completely for free to give a try if you want to try out my work and see what kind of writing I do."

      "Fortunately I haven't done any of the illustrations in my books since the Aons in Elantris, and those were all redone in-house. I have very little talent with visual art, though for The Way of Kings I did get to have a lot more influence on the art than many authors might have been able to have. Irene at Tor was very good to work with; she gave me some leeway that she really didn't have to.\r\n\r\nI worked very closely with the artists to get what I wanted. Some of the pieces went through a half dozen or a dozen drafts as we explored and tried to feel out what was in my head, and have the artist add to that until we came to pieces that we were satisfied with. So it was a very interesting process. It wasn't simply \"submit a description, get a piece back.\" It was \"submit a vague description, talk to the artist on the phone, get across what I'm trying to do, send lots of examples of other art that's like it, get some early drafts, nudge one direction or another, keep working on it.\" Some of these pieces took months to do.",

      "They say you can�t judge a book by its cover. I�ve always wondered who �They� are, and if�by chance�they�ve never heard of Michael Whelan. Because my experience in life has been very different.\r\nIt�s been almost twenty years now since I first discovered Michael�s work. I was fourteen when it happened, and I was not a reader. I�d been handed a succession of novels about young boys living in the wilderness and taking care of their pet dogs. (Which would die by the end of the book.) I disliked reading with a passion. So, when my eighth-grade teacher assigned me to do a book report, I did everything I could to get out of it.\r\nThat failed. In fact, it failed so solidly that the teacher�unwilling to let me choose my own book to read, for fear I�d choose something not up my reading level�steered me to the back of the room, where she kept a group of ratty paperbacks to loan out to students. You probably know the type�ripped, stained by spaghetti sauce from cafeteria lunches, pages folded and worn. I was told I had to read one of these and had to do a book report on them�and she�d read them all, so she�d know if I tried to fake it.\r\nSullen and annoyed, I began to sift through the books. Most looked terrible. I resigned myself to another dead dog story, but then one of the books actually caught my eye. It had this vivid painting of a dragon standing in the mists, a woman held limply in its hand. Dragonsbane, by Barbara Hambly. The painting was so beautiful, so realistic yet imaginative, that I snatched it up, actually a little eager to look through the pages. I ended up taking it home with me.\r\nI read that book in one day. It wasn�t like anything I�d ever tried reading before. (I had never been introduced to fantasy novels.) Dragonsbane was amazing, challenging, imaginative, gripping, and beautiful all wrapped up in one. I remember a severe bout of disappointment upon finishing the book because I thought surely there couldn�t be anything else like it in the entire world.\r\nStill, hopeful, I visited the school library the next day. I looked through the card catalog, and picked the next book�alphabetically by title�after Dragonsbane. It was called Dragonflight, by Anne McCaffrey. I went and pulled it out, and was once again captivated by the cover. I took it home and read it.\r\nMy life changed. Now, we throw around sentences like that in writing, using them over and over again until they become as worn as the shoes of a traveling salesman�hardly capable of holding meaning any longer. But let me say it again. My life changed.\r\nI devoured every Anne McCaffrey book in the school library. Suddenly, what I�d discovered in Dragonsbane wasn�t a single, freak event. There was a pattern. If two authors could do this, perhaps there were others. Hungry for more, I went to the bookstore and discovered there was an entire fantasy genre.\r\nThere were so many books. Which to choose? Dragons had treated me well so far, so I looked for some dragon books. And there, right on the shelf, was a beautiful book called Dragon Prince. I consumed it, and then everything else Melanie Rawn was writing.\r\nWhat do these books all share? It wasn�t just the dragons; it was the covers. Each time, there was something dramatic and special about them. I now own prints of Dragonsbane and several of Melanie�s covers. All were painted by Michael Whelan.\r\nBy the time Tad Williams� Dragonbone Chair came out, I could recognize Michael�s art on sight. And I also knew to trust it. It didn�t seem logical�you really shouldn�t be able to judge a book by its cover. But a Whelan cover became a seal of approval to me, a sign that the publisher trusted the book so much that they got the best person available to do the cover.\r\nI can�t tell you all of the authors Whelan�s art led me to over the years: Patricia Mckillip, Joan D. Vinge, Stephen Donaldson, and even Asimov. (Yes, you read that right. I first picked up Asimov because Whelan had done the new Foundation covers.)\r\nI remember when winter 1993 rolled around. My local bookseller noted to me that Whelan had a new art book coming out, one half dedicated to covers, one half dedicated to his fine art. It was the only thing I requested for Christmas, and my parents bought it for me despite the cost. I spent hours leafing through the wonderous, fantastic art. Those imagines sparked things in my mind. I was an author in embryo, absorbing, thinking, dreaming. One of the very first stories I ever wrote was a �fanfic� based on Whelan�s Passage series of fine art prints.\r\nThe years have passed. There are other wonderful fantasy artists out there�and, in a way, the market has finally caught up to Whelan (much as the fantasy genre itself needed time to catch up to Tolkien.) I�ve been lucky to have some of those incredible artists paint covers for my books. But I�ve rarely felt as much excitement, wonder, and awe as I did the when I got to open an email and see the cover for The Way of Kings.\r\nIrene Gallo (Tor�s art director) asked me to provide a quote about how I feel having a Whelan cover on one of my books. My editor, Moshe, noted �Surely you�ll mention how it�s a dream come true for both you and your editor.� But 'Dream come true' is another one of those phrases we use so often it has lost its meaning.\r\nHow do I really feel? Well, when I was a senior in high school, I was forced to take a life-planning class. In that class, we had to write down ten 'life goals' we wanted to achieve some day. #1 on my list, which I still have somewhere, was �Publish a book someday that is good enough to deserve a Michael Whelan cover.�\r\nIt has always been a deep-seated desire of mine to one day have a Whelan painting on one of my works. Without this man�s skill and vision, I might never have discovered the fantasy genre, and I might not be writing novels today.\r\nYou might say I�m a little bit pleased."

I helped him develop her by saying, \"Why on earth is she always riding up there to talk to Moiraine?

There�s no way that anyone could have made that book at that speed. It�s a book that takes a year, maybe eighteen months to write. So for long epic fantasies, New York certainly has some things going for it.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons that it�s really good to publish fast and short when you�re doing self-publishing is that you don�t have any sort of marketing push behind you. You don�t have bookstore shelf presence, which is one of the major forms of marketing�people seeing your book there on the shelves. Word of mouth is always the most important thing, but it becomes even more important for the self-published writer. Publishing quickly and getting a lot of books out helps to get your name in more places in the market and helps to push some of that momentum through. That seems to be the key way to make it as a self-published writer.\r\n\r\nWhen would I self-publish versus New York-publish? I would not abandon either model. Self-publishing has proved itself so viable recently that if I were a new writer, I would be looking at doing both at the same time. Maybe taking the longer, more epic-style books to New York and doing the faster-paced, more thriller-style books online, and seeing what works best.\r\n\r\nSo the expansion of the e-book market gives you more places to go. That said, if you�re not a particularly fast writer, self-publishing is going to be a very hard route for you because everything I�ve seen�granted, I�m not an expert on this; there are places to go other than me for expertise�shows that being able to produce quickly is a key factor in being a successful self-published author in this market."

      "Travel Guide to Medieval Europe\r\n\r\nWhy are so many fantasy settings based on medieval Europe?  The journeys through these new worlds seem familiar because they have this common root ancestor.  There are exceptions, such as Daniel Abraham's Long Price Quartet or Jane Lindskold's Thirteen Orphans, but they tend not to catch on in a big way.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite non-European settings is Stephen King's Dark Tower world.  This apocalyptic Old West is one of the most unique landscapes in speculative fiction, and it shows that the fantasy fan is willing to branch out.  Granted, the Stephen King name helps.  There's also Star Wars, which is as much fantasy as science fiction.  It features a traditional fantasy plot (rescuing the princess and overthrowing an evil empire) in an outer space setting.\r\n\r\nSo what other cultures or time periods are ripe for a fantasy interpretation?  I'd vote for Shogun-era Japan."

      "Answering questions like this one is difficult; it's like \"Pick your favorite food\". If you eat that food every day you're going to eventually hate it...or slowly find the food less and less enjoyable. For me, that's how it is with writing.\r\nEpic Fantasy is my favorite form, but if I'm only ever doing Epic Fantasy, I feel like I will get burned out on it, and I'll stop enjoying it as much and so I don't want to see that happen. So when I start to feel like it, I let myself, within certain bounds, write whatever I want to write so that when I get back to Epic Fantasy I'm feeling fresh. It's not a matter of what I like to write the most, it's a matter of what I'm feeling like at the time. Sometimes you may not want to eat your favorite food.\r\nRebecca Lovatt\r\nAnd when you're switching between these different types of stories, are there any major difficulties that you face?\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nIf I do, then it means something's going wrong and I kind of need to look at why I'm trying to write it... Switching is not hard, usually. You get to know your writing style, you get comfortable with how you approach things."

      "You create some of the most elaborate magic systems in fantasy today; these systems function as intrinsic parts of your worlds and characters. Typically, how do you address the different types of magic systems in your different books? Do you define these systems before you start writing the books, or do they evolve and develop as you go along?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "The answer to that is yes! It's different for every book. With my Cosmere books—which are the shared universe of my epic fantasies—I need to be a little more rigorous. There are fundamental underlying principles that guide the magic systems, and so there's a larger developmental phase before I start writing the book. Then I stick more strictly to the rules I've given myself.\r\n\r\nAll the way back in 2007, I was writing one of my epic fantasies, and it just wasn't working. I needed a break to something creative, different, and distinctive. So I jumped ship, abandoning that epic fantasy, and wrote The Rithmatist instead, which had a lot less planning than one of my epic fantasies.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWith something like The Rithmatist—which is outside the Cosmere—I'm allowed a little more freedom, which is one of the reasons I like writing books like this, where I allow myself to develop it as I write. The magic was the first thing that got me excited about The Rithmatist, so I based the book around it.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I wrote was the scene—now late in chapter one—where Joel watches Fitch get defeated by Nalizar in the classroom. It started out on a chalkboard, but I eventually moved it to the floor because that made more sense. As I was writing these chapters, I developed the Rithmatic lines and let the story feed the magic and the magic feed the story in a way that some writers call \"discovery written.\""

      "My great journey to see Brandon Sanderson started at about 1:00 in the afternoon... I arrived at the signing at about 2:00 and then met up with some fellow 17th Sharders (Shivertongue and his friends) and we hung out at the mall across the street from the Borders where the signing would occur. We got back to the Borders at about 5:30 or so and acquired our wristbands to assure our places in line. From there we commandeered an entire row of seats(not the front row... but we should have) and sat around talking with fellow fans of Brandon for the next hour and 45 minutes or so.\r\n\r\nI got to explain the fixing of Elantris to someone. That was fun.\r\n\r\nBrandon was late. From what I can tell this is pretty normal for him. The employees at the store said he hit traffic... I think he just didn't want to leave the restaurant where he had dinner because their food is quite awesome.\r\n\r\nBrandon then did a reading from The Way of Kings in which he read the prelude. He also explained that the prelude is really a second prologue... and that the book doesn't really start until chapter 2. Also, it is entirely my fault that the reading did not get recorded. The mic I was using to record was a powered mic which I of course forgot to turn on until about halfway through the reading. Way to go me!\r\n\r\nThen the Q&A portion of the night happened. I recorded all of this. The audio is available here...\r\n\r\nListed below are all the questions asked during the Q&A session.

      "So, in that regard, you know, thinking about the tools of the internet, the possibilities of harnessing so many different voices via a social network, or so on, how do you feel about the concept of shared worlds and collaborative writing?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Um, it's interesting. I think you can do some very different things with the internet that you couldn't have done before. Everyone I've talked to who's collaborated on a book has told me that collaborating is twice the work for half the money. And some people's minds work pretty well that way; they work as a team. I mean, Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven obviously work very well as a team; some of their greatest fiction came when they worked together, and the internet can allow for some of that, but I'm also skeptical at the same time because I've seen...I don't know. One of the things that's great about novels, that you don't get in other story-telling mediums—particularly you don't get in television or movies, which is our dominant story-telling medium right now—is a single person's vision, and that has its own foibles, and it has its own benefits, but when you read one of my books, you are reading my vision for a story. I may have gotten feedback on it, I may have had an editor tell me, \"Hey, you should do this; you should do that,\" but every word that gets changed is changed by me. Everything that happens is done by me. And reading about the movie industry, there's some great movies that come out, but they're hugely collaborative works, and it seems that sometimes that so many people getting their fingers in the pie makes a movie end up losing some of its magic and vision.\r\nOf course not always—there are fantastic films—but some time if you want to have an interesting time, read the essay \"Building the Bomb\" by Terry Rossio. Terry Rossio is a famous screenwriter—he did the Pirates of the Caribbean movies; he did the Aladdin screenplay with his writing partner together—and he wrote a series of essays talking about the process, and this one is now like ten years old, but it talks about the creation of the Puppet Masters movie, the classic Heinlein novel turned into a movie—I think it's The Puppet Masters; it's one of the Heinlein scripts—but he loved the book, and he adapted it, and it goes through, step-by-step, how the life got torn out of that script because of the different people who wanted to be part of the project, not for artistic reasons, but because they wanted their names  attached to it, or they wanted this person involved, or they wanted that, and it can kinda scare you sometimes what happens. I'm shocked that the artists in Hollywood—the screenwriters and the visionary directors and cinematographers, and people—are actually able to get anything artistic created, considering how much they have to go through.\r\nBILL CUNNINGHAM\r\nWe aren't. We don't. I'm in Hollywood, so...\r\nCHRISTIAN LINDKE\r\nThat's one of the things that makes, I think, television, right now, a little bit better when it comes to writing than film is, it goes through fewer collaborative bubbles.\r\nBRANDON SANDERSON\r\nTelevision's gotten great lately, comparing what we had in the 90s to what you have right now...Wow. It's night and day.\r\nBILL CUNNINGHAM\r\nYeah."

By the definition of the term, it's not a deus ex machina as long as what's possible and what someone can do has been foreshadowed. For example, at the end of book five when Rand goes to Caemlyn and brings Mat back to life using balefire, that would only be deus ex machina if the reader didn't know ahead of time that it was possible. But once you have the ability to rewind time, some really funky plotting things can happen. There are certainly criticisms that can be leveled. But deus ex machina is the wrong term.\r\n\r\nJohn Ottinger\r\nEditor's Note: For more on these concepts, read Sanderson's and Weeks' dueling posts on the topic at Babel Clash."

It certainly seems to imply, however, that the title Dragon is not completely exclusive to Rand, but does put it outside the realms of possibility for Demandred. Kind of a frustrating answer in terms of settling the debate, but interesting nonetheless.\r\nAs to my wild (but not quite looney) theory, I'm wondering if it isn't possible that someone else will actually end up fulfilling Rand's role at the end of the series. It would be a huge bait and switch and possible unsatisfying for us, but there does seem to be a possibility, both in terms of the Logain prophecy of glory, and in terms of the original conception of the series, in that the Chosen One couldn't do it for whatever reason and someone else had to step in. To my mind, from both Brandon's playful manner and his reply, it certainly seems as if something from AMOL ties into this. Then again, I might be reading too much into a smile and a nod."

How do you keep them all straight in your head? And, when one project is finished, how do you choose which one to work on next?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Choosing the next project is a balance between the promises I've made to readers and the best way to channel my creativity. I stay fresh by jumping between projects; it's the way I've (for better or worse) trained myself. And so I always have a lot of ideas, and there are a lot of things I've worked on.\r\nOne thing to keep in mind with me is that, because of the way I work, some of these things just don't end up turning out. They aren't good enough for publication, at least in their current state, so I shelve them. Imagine it like the B-sides of an album. The band may do a lot of playing, jamming, and recording�and then they pick the very best to present to their listeners.\r\nIn the case of the books mentioned above, Liar turned out poorly enough on the first go-around that it's shelved indefinitely. I'm not sure how I stand on The King's Necromancer yet, and White Sand is unlikely to be in good shape for many years. Scribbler (one you didn't mention) turned out great, and you'll probably see it in the near future.\r\nAs for sequels to books that are half-promised, we'll see. Something like Nightblood (where there is a potential sequel, but the story of the book was wrapped up and told strongly, I feel) is less urgent than something like the rest of the Stormlight Archive (which is a single story, told across many books.) In the case of Stormlight, I've made a stronger promise to readers, one I feel the need to fulfill.\r\nOf course, the question you asked is how I keep them all straight. Lots of notes mixed with quirks of the way my brain works.",

The connection between Slayer and the new breed of Darkhounds is not explicit, but it is still pretty obvious. Luc and Isam are mentioned in connection with the Darkhounds in the Dark Prophecy written on the dungeon wall in The Great Hunt Chapter 7. He was killing wolves in Tel'aran'rhiod in The Shadow Rising Chapter 28, and the reality-bending properties of the Unseen World might explain the T2 Darkhounds."

      "How did the idea germinate and come to fruition for the gem-studded magic system of The Way of Kings?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "One of the things to keep in mind is I that developed this book before Mistborn was published. I do wonder if sometimes people are going to say, \"Oh, he did metals before, and now he's doing crystals.\" But the thoughts arose quite independently in my head. You may know that there is a unifying theory of magic for all of my worlds�a behind-the-scenes rationale. Like a lot of people believe there's unifying theory of physics, I have a unifying theory of magic that I try to work within in order to build my worlds. As an armchair scientist, believing in a unifying theory helps me. I'm always looking for interesting ways that magic can be transferred, and interesting ways that people can become users of magic. I don't want just to fall into expected methodologies. If you look at a lot of fantasy�and this is what I did in Mistborn so it's certainly not bad; or if is, I'm part of the problem�a lot of magic is just something you're born with. You're born with this special power that is either genetic or placed upon you by fate, or something like that. In my books I want interesting and different ways of doing that. That's why in Warbreaker the magic is simply the ability to accumulate life force from other people, and anyone who does that becomes a practitioner of magic.\r\n\r\nIn The Way of Kings, I was looking for some sort of reservoir. Essentially, I wanted magical batteries, because I wanted to take this series toward developing a magical technology. The first book only hints at this, in some of the art and some of the things that are happening. There's a point where one character's fireplace gets replaced with a magical device that creates heat. And he's kind of sad, thinking something like, \"I liked my hearth, but now I can touch this and it creates heat, which is still a good thing.\" But we're seeing the advent of this age, and therefore I wanted something that would work with a more mystical magic inside of a person and that could also form the basis for a mechanical magic. That was one aspect of it. Another big aspect is that I always like to have a visual representation, something in my magic to show that it's not all just happening abstractly but that you can see happen. I loved the imagery of glowing gemstones. When I wrote Mistborn I used Burning metals�metabolizing metals�because it's a natural process and it's an easy connection to make. Even though it's odd in some ways, it's natural in other ways; metabolizing food is how we all get our energy. The idea of a glowing object, illuminated and full of light, is a natural connection for the mind to make: This is a power source; this is a source of natural energy. And since I was working with the highstorms, I wanted some way that you could trap the energy of the storm and use it. The gemstones were an outgrowth of that."

      "More on Foreshadowing\r\n\r\nBrent, I think you're absolutely right several places in there.  (Though I feel like I should object on principle, so there's more conflict to our narrative.  Good storytelling, and all that.)\r\n\r\nYes, there are things I can get away with now that I couldn't before�or ones I didn't try to get away with before.  One big one is flashbacks.  In my early years as a writer, published and unpublished, I stayed far away from flashbacks.  Partially because I'd been told to do so, and partially because I'd seen them done poorly from a large number of other new writers.  There are good reasons to stay away from them, and the advice is good.  If you do flashbacks the wrong way, you'll break the flow of your narrative, risk undermining the tension of your story, confuse the reader, and basically make a big old mess.\r\n\r\nThen Pat Rothfuss comes along and does a narrative-within-a-narrative where the entire book is basically flashback, and it works really well.  I do know, however, that Pat had a lot of trouble selling that book of his to start.  (Though admittedly, I'm not sure if that was the flashbacks or not.  I seem to remember he added the frame story later in the process, and that the huge length of the book was what was scaring people away at first.)\r\n\r\nI guess this brings us back to the first rule of writing: you can do whatever you want, if you do it well.  Regardless, I decided�after some deliberation�that I'd use flashbacks as an extensive device in The Way of Kings and the rest of the series.  None of these were in earlier drafts of the novel, however, because I knew that many readers (and editors) have a knee-jerk reaction against flashbacks because of how likely they are to screw things up.  Now that I'm established, however, I feel that people will trust me when they see them.\r\n\r\n(One thing I'm leaving out is that I think I'm a better writer now than I was before, and if I'd tried these flashbacks during earlier days, I'd likely have flubbed them.)\r\n\r\nYou talk about foreshadowing, and make some great points.  One thing I think that I want to bring up is the idea of nesting reveals.  I always try to have a nice spectrum of types of plot twists and revelations in the book.  Some are easier to figure out, others more difficult.  My experience has been that some readers want to try to guess what is going to happen, and others do not, but both appreciate a legitimate twist in the story.  (One that was clearly foreshadowed, but not made obvious.)  As so yes, there are going to be different types of readers, and some will see the foreshadowing that others will not.  Some won't care at all if the story just twists unexpectedly (and without explanation) while others will consider it a put-downable offense.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of tossing questions back and forth, then, let me ask you this: I just mentioned above that you can do anything in your writing if you do it well.  Yet I've also talked a lot about the importance of foreshadowing.  What do you think?  Is it ever justified to have a total Deus Ex Machina?  (For those who don't know, this refers to a major plot twist�usually involving the heroes/protagonists being rescued from danger unexpectedly�that is not explained or foreshadowed.)  How might one do this well?  Or is it an exception to my rule?  Is my rule even really a good rule?\r\n\r\n(Also, all, please forgive typos in this post.  Just back from book tour after a long day traveling, and wanted to make sure I got this posted.  But I'm kind of drooping here.)"

These chances I got were so useful to me that I think I would be remiss if I didn't do it myself.\"\r\n\r\nMichael De Groote\r\nBut as successful as Sanderson has been, he tries to keep that success in perspective. Although huge lines and crowds will, if past events are any indication, gather for his book launch at midnight on March 4 at BYU Bookstore in Provo, fame isn't a motivator.\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\n\"Fortunately, writers don't get that famous; even famous writers don't get that famous,\" he said. \"Like if you were to walk out on that street and say, 'Hey guys, Brandon Sanderson is in this room,' I can guarantee that nobody would care. There might be one person who might say, 'Hey, I've heard of that guy. Didn't he write those books?' Nobody would care. ... And so it is very easy to keep well-grounded as a writer.\""

      "The next question was about the criteria that the Ajah Heads used to determine which sitters they sent to the rebels in Salidar.",

      "Basically the Ajah heads had a small selection pool to start with. Their primary criteria were: a) loyalty to the Ajah Heads, would they do as they were told? b) would they be acceptable to the Aes Sedai in Salidar? c) finally did the Ajah Heads think they could be persuasive?\r\nA comment was made about age, Brandon�s answer was to reiterate the limited nature of the Ajah Heads selection pool, the fact that most of the Aes Sedai Sitters that were sent were young was coincidental. He did go on to mention that the �too young Sitters� was a completely different matter.\r\nHe then went on to say which Sitters remain in power after reunification will be dealt with quietly. The most likely default will be who was Sitter/Head before the split.",

      "While majoring in English at college, Sanderson took a job as a hotel receptionist, working the graveyard shift.\r\n\r\nThe managers didn't mind if he wrote on the job. \"In fact, they were happy if I did, because that meant I wasn't falling asleep like the previous person they'd hired. So I wrote—oh gosh, it must have been nine or 10 novels over the course of five years.\"\r\n\r\nSanderson was living one of the standard writer-learns-the-ropes stories—turning out book after book after book, finding his voice, finding the stories that mattered to him, and finding the self-belief to swallow the rejection letters. There were a lot of rejection letters. He made his way through the forest of fantasy and science fiction sub-genres, one at a time. \"I did a post-apocalyptic book, I did an epic fantasy, I did a comic fantasy, I did some cerebral science fiction, I did a short action adventure fantasy...\"\r\n\r\nNo one wanted any of them. In frustration he tried to figure out what kind of books publishers were looking for, so he could write one.\r\n\r\n\"We call this chasing the market and it's a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea and I did it anyway. The next two books I wrote were the two worst I'd done. I mean, I'd learned something from all those unsold novels and technically they were okay, but they didn't have any soul, they were just dreadful books. I didn't even send them out.\"\r\n\r\nInstead he sat down and deliberately wrote something profligately, ridiculously unpublishable. \"I had to say okay, I'm a writer, I love it, this is what I do. Getting published is not the aim. Writing is the aim. So okay. I'm going to ignore what everybody's been telling me in these rejection letters. I'm going to write the biggest, coolest, baddest, most awesome fantasy epic I can. All these ideas that I've told myself are too big, that I'm going to have to put off using, I'm not going to put off any more. And I sat down and I wrote The Way of Kings. I sank everything into it. I created this awesome beast of a novel, and to be perfectly honest, my skill wasn't up to doing it justice at that point, but I gave it everything I had.\"",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "\"You know, I trimmed it a lot. It's the right length. It's the length it needs to be. It's fair to say it is not a small book.\" Sanderson is talking about The Way of Kings, his latest novel. It is, and let's just fixate on this for a moment, very long, indeed.\r\n\r\nDavid Larsen\r\nOne of my favourite New Zealand novels, Nigel Cox's The Cowboy Dog, is about 60,000 words long. If you put six copies of The Cowboy Dog between one set of covers, The Way of Kings would still be longer. The first time Sanderson showed it to a publisher, the response was a shaky, \"Do you know what getting this thing printed and bound would cost us?\"\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nSanderson laughed, and offered the publisher three smaller books instead. Those three books made his name, attracted a very scary phone call, and made The Way of Kings a viable publishing proposition. But let's back up a little."

And I remember when the first time I realized that I was doing what you just said—that I was doing for people what people had done for me—was when I started getting my first emails. And I had gotten one from someone who said to me, it was a young man, 'Your books are what made me start reading.' And it stomped me, it throws me, and it floored me, because I have trouble believing I belong on the shelf with all those writers that I grew up reading, because they're the masters and I'm just the journeyman. I got into this because of them. And that was the first moment where I froze, and I said, 'Oh, wow! It's happening. I mean, I'm part of this. It's a cycle. It's a circle. I'm giving back to what people gave to me.' It really was a strange and surreal moment, and I just sat and stared at the screen for a little while."

Well the Powell's book store worker said to me, \"well we have Forkroot from Tor.com right over here.\" I looked over to see him waving at me, he came over and told me how he ended up there (which he talked about in his posting). As forkroot mentioned we also collected a gathering of people to talk to.\r\n\r\nThey called the ticket holders up 10 people at a time and so I was in the third group of people near the end of the line #28. When I was at the front of the line I introduced myself to Brandon. I told him my screen name at Tor.com said I heard He at met Freelancer at another signing, he remembers you. I then mentioned that we all had come of with some more questions for him and were wondering if he had time. He told me to stick around to the end and he would spend some time with us (I told him about Forkroot as well). Done with my time, I went back and hung out with Forkroot and the others, where we discussed all the same things we all discuss on here. Forkroot then had his turn. After he was done there were a few more people, and then the Storm Leaders had the picture and signings. Forkroot and I had our picture taken with Brandon, then we all went outside after profusely thanking the Powell's store staff, and enviously thanking the Storm Leaders.\r\n\r\nOut in front of the store, Forkroot, myself and a couple of our new friends gathered around Brandon.

      "Firstly he read from his novella, Legion, which is out in November [I think??]. It's about a genius whose genius manifests in the form of hallucinations. Basically whenever this guy studies anything, he creates a hallucinatory expert that retains the full extent of all this knowledge like a repository, and it is with his 'legion' of hallucinatory experts that his full genius and ability comes from.\r\n\r\nOn the second day he read from a new novel set in the Elantris world (though in a whole different part of the world, with completely new characters (barring, of course, Hoid)). I didn�t write it down, but the title was something like 'Soul of the Dragon Emperor'. The magic system involves Forgers, people who can through study and understanding something�s past, forge a soulseal which can change that past so long as it is touching the thing itself. So a Forger could look at an old and battered table, and by studying it—understanding where the wood came from, where the polish came from, so forth—they could then create a soulseal that says the table has been lovingly and carefully cared for, and so long as that seal is laid into the table, the table will no longer be battered and old, but perfectly polished. This is the gist of the plot as well, that something has happened to the Emperor and a talents Forger who works as a thief is supposed to Forge the Emperor�s soul so that it appears as if nothing has happened.\r\n\r\nOther than that the only other thing I have in my notes is that Shallan is to be the Stormlight 2 Flashback character.",

I asked Brandon to confirm that it wasn't Alivia and was in fact Nakomi and he said he wouldn't answer anything about Nakomi, but vehemently denied Alivia had anything to do with the swap.\r\n\r\n\r\nTsorovanSaidin\r\nThe body swap was a result of the crossed balefire stream.\r\n\r\n\r\ncraiye\r\nSure, it's clear that was what triggered the whole event but the end of A Memory of Light heavily implies that the woman outside Shayol Ghul finalized the deal. I'd assume that was Nakomi.\r\n\r\nAnyways, BS has made it clear he can't/won't answer any questions about Nakomi so I was just hoping for a solid confirmation that Alivia wasn't involved in anything at Shayol Ghul, and he confirmed that. That was good enough for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTsorovanSaidin\r\nOhhhh you're talking the old woman in the tent with Alivia? I'm almost positive it was Caddy and Alivia was referring to her as an old woman. You're talking about \"The wise ones and the old woman with them\" line correct? It's not Verin, we know that much. Nakomi, I'm convinced is no one, and everyone is just assuming there's something special about her. Though I found that old woman line suspicious.\r\n\r\n\r\ncraiye\r\nNah, I'm talking about the first page of the epilogue—892. The figure outside Shayol Ghul that says \"Yes, that's good. That is what you need to do\" as he brings Moridin's body out. For some reason a fair amount of people I've talked too (including the group I read with) thought that was Alivia, since it's suggested this person starts the body swap at that point (or finishes it I suppose). BS confirmed it was NOT Alivia though. I assume it's Nakomi. Who Nakomi actually is is an entirely different story."

At the time, I was furnishing a doll's house I had had as a child; it had never gotten properly furnished�and this was really important psychic work I was doing, I guess�and I remember he brought a present to me, and I've forgotten whether it was on Christmas or my birthday�and I was sitting at the dinner table, and he was standing over this small box, and I start to open it, and I realized he was going *heavy breathing noises* because he was so anxious, breathing, would I like it?

This time, he called up Michael Whelan and asked if he could somehow get prints of the cover to sell.\r\n\r\nThe result is that we're going to be selling them at that signing, and ONLY that signing. In fact, so far as I know, this is the only place to get prints of the cover painting right now. Mr. Whelan has already signed each one, and I'll be signing them when in Lexington. [Assistant Peter's note: Michael Whelan will also sell them on his own website�we'll put up a link later�at the same price ($95), but getting it from Joseph-Beth will be faster. If you're not going to the signing you can order it here. There may also be a few prints of the The Way of Kings cover painting available at the signing itself.]"

      "Other Eligible Works\r\n\r\nWriting Excuses Season Eight is also eligible in the Best Related Work category. We won last year, which was thrilling. Thank you all for your nominations and votes! (I believe we won by three votes.)\r\n\r\n\"Lift,\" which you can read for free here, is eligible in the novelette category. Though it is part of Words of Radiance, it also stands on its own, and is worth consideration.\r\n\r\nBoth Steelheart and The Rithmatist are eligible in the Hugo novel category and are, I believe, eligible for the Andre Norton Award.\r\n\r\nI also have other shorts eligible in various categories, but I think the ones listed above are the stronger works."

      "By now you're probably very familiar with the whole AmazonFail deal that has been going on. Today, Scalzi made a shout-out for author support. I think that was a fine thing to do.\r\n\r\nMost of the authors involved don't care so much about ebook pricing either way. They just want people to read their works. In fact, the majority of writers I know care about money only in so much as it allows them to keep writing books. Money is important because without it, we'd all have to be working in a cubicle somewhere rather than creating the art that we love.\r\n\r\nSome will argue that $9.99 is too low for an ebook, others that it's too high. I'm not really on either side, to be honest. I see it both ways. But I do agree that what Amazon did in pulling physical books was a petulant, annoying move that harms a bunch of people who had nothing to do with the negotiations. Scalzi, in his nefarious evil wisdom, calls for everyone to show support to the authors and get their books someplace other than Amazon.\r\n\r\nThis strikes me as particularly important for authors who released books either last week or this week. For those of us who had book launches before the holidays, most of you who want our books already have them. But think of Steven Erikson, who had a new book come out a couple of weeks ago. Or heck, Ben Bova, Charlie Stross, and L. E. Modesitt Jr. had books come out today. First week sales, as everyone knows, are very important for a book's future. What Amazon did to me was annoying; what it did to these folks was downright nasty."

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "It's always been both. But once you become a professional, the less fun aspects of it are the revision, particularly revising on a deadline. The writing of the actual books is still as fun as it ever was. But in the old days, if I didn't want to revise something at a certain moment, I just didn't have to. Even when I was not as popular as I am now, I didn't have to revise right away because there was so much time between when I turned in a book and when it came out. Nowadays, when editorial comments come in, I've basically got to drop everything and do revisions. I've never liked revising very much. So I would say that part of it feels more like work, while the rest of it feels about the same"

      "The Tower Guards had agreed to meet before the signing at the Rusty Bucket near the bookstore and after meeting with the bookstore I headed over there to meet my fellow tower guards. Upon arrival I passed out our shirts and sat down. We ordered drinks and began by introducing ourselves and what we knew of each other. Skipping the details of our planning we began to discuss the books themselves. Only two of us, myself included, had finished Towers of Midnight so we had to be careful with our discussion lest we ruin it all. Where nerds gather the conversation is bound to get animated and we discussed many things over good drinks and some homemade brownies that one of our Tower Guards provided. Yum, mint.\r\n\r\nWe talked for almost two hours before we needed to be at the bookstore to meet Brandon at six. Around 5:45 we paid our tabs and moved over to the bookstore to meet with the staff again. Since the question of our duties during the signing were still up in the air we were herded into the upstairs break-room. We made ourselves at home and discussed our impending meet with Brandon and Harriet. Unfortunately, Brandon's flight due to the time difference going from the West to East coast was due in at 6pm as opposed to the 2:45PM the bookstore staff expected. Brandon and Harriet themselves arrived straight from the airport at 6:30ish and proceeded once freshening up to being signing pre-release copies for those attendees who wanted a signed copy but could not stay."

Telander\r\nDo you ever think you'll get publishing those at all?\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nIf I did it would be just a labor of love because they're so scatter-brained.

I won't say no, but I'll say it's highly unlikely because this is something I do just to relax and have fun. It's mainly something I do every other week so that I have something scheduled that I spend time with my friends and my brother. You know, I sit down and have to schedule these things in my life these days. And it allows me to just be bizarre. Some of these things are pretty bizarre. You don't even want to hear what is happening in these campaigns.\r\n\r\nAlex C. Telander\r\n[laughs] I'm sure.\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nYou know, maybe. For years I've wanted to do something that I don't see a lot in gaming, which is really self contained, one volume, kind of like we have one volume epic fantasies. One volume campaign, rules, story that only the DM has, or the GM has, and make learning the rules part of the fun of the exploring the world. Instead of having everyone read all these rule books ahead of time, and then sit down and play.\r\n\r\nAlex C. Telander\r\nRight. You kind of discover as you go.\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nYou discover as you go, and you learn the rules as you go, and build an RPG that does it that way. Like, I usually start my campaigns with the characters with having no memory, they're blank slates. They all wake up and they discover a world, and even the mechanics of the world, as their players do, which is a very fun way to do it."

      "How do you imagine all this magic? Tell us briefly of your rules of magic.",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Seven or eight years ago, I was thinking about what I love in fantasy. My love of the fantasy genre is this sense of another world that really couldn't, but for a while, we pretend that it could. With a science background, (I started my academic life as a chemist) I like to imagine worlds where our fundamental laws of physics don't apply but other fundamental laws of physics do. And so, for me, I like \"magic\" to be a new branch of physics that only exists in these worlds. That sounds a little sterile. It's more sterile than I wanted to sound because I think science has this wonder to it, and as you discover and you learn, there's this beautiful sense of discovery.\r\n\r\nIt's where the great discoveries of our age is happening and scientific. I love particularly the era at the turn of the 19th to 20th century. The feel the people had for science back then—I often find myself writing in my books during a similar era, an age you might call an enlightenment. That's really the Renaissance, a little post-Renaissance age of industry where people are discovering that the magic follows rules and laws.\r\n\r\nI have rules for myself about how to write my magic systems and these are really just storytelling rules. I call them Sanderson's Laws. I can't really go into depth in an article here. (I've done essays on them, you can Google them.) But they're really writing advice to myself. I call them Sanderson's Laws, not because I think everyone should follow them, but they are laws I follow myself.\r\n\r\nThey have to do with things like properly laying the foreshadowing for my magic so the reader understands what it can do and looking and exploring the different aspects of what a magic can do rather than adding a ton of new powers. Taking one power and setting (to see) if I can really explore it in its depth, things like that."

I think your Mistborn world would make an excellent setting for a game. I'd love to play a game with allomantic and feruchemical powers. Is this something you've considered pursuing? \r\n\r\nThanks for the question, Steve!  I'm a gamer myself�a big fan of RPGs and FPSs.  (And I've put off playing Halo Three, which I really want to play, until I get A Memory of Light written.  It's been kind of hard.) \r\n\r\nI HAVE considered doing a Mistborn game.  In fact, I was in talks with a company at one point to licence the game to them.  I even wrote up a proposal for the game.  (I imagined it being a nice hybrid between an RPG and a platformer, perhaps something along the lines of the metroid/castlevania vein with a physics engine.  Or, for something more big budget, I'd love to see a Morrowind style Mistborn RPG.) \r\n\r\nThat deal fell through, however, and I don't blame the company for going another direction.  Still, I'm openly pursing this option.  If any of you out there work for a video game company and might be interested in a Mistborn game, feel free to fire me off an email!  I'll respond faster than six weeks on something like that.  ;)\r\n\r\nAnd while it's something kind of different, we've still got the Mistborn Pen and Paper RPG coming out, which has me VERY excited.  If I had to chose between a video game and a pen and paper like this, I'd go with the pen and paper first.  I think it offers a more complete and immersive experience, and the chance to work with Crafty has me psyched."

      "For more information about Brandon Sanderson and his books, check out his website.\r\n\r\nAbout Steelheart: Ten years ago, Calamity came. It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics.\r\n\r\nBut Epics are no friend of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man you must crush his wills.\r\n\r\nNobody fights the Epics... nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans, they spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then assassinating them.\r\n\r\nAnd David wants in. He wants Steelheart—the Epic who is said to be invincible. The Epic who killed David's father. For years, like the Reckoners, David's been studying, and planning—and he has something they need. Not an object, but an experience.\r\n\r\nHe's seen Steelheart bleed. And he wants revenge.\r\n\r\nJoin us September 28th at the Austin Convention Center to meet Brandon Sanderson and have your books signed! Be sure to follow us on Twitter and Facebook for more news soon!",

      "Ha! I don't know if I hate any of my characters enough to do that to them! What interesting questions you have! I think Kelsier from Mistborn would probably fit in the best. Not a lot of people pick up on this, but Kelsier is actually a psychopath. He likes to kill people. He takes pleasure and joy in it. He only lets this side of himself out once in a while, but there are points in the book where he takes down a nobleman, and he's just gleeful about the ability and the chance to do it.\r\n\r\nIn the Mistborn world, he's a hero because the people Kelsier is killing are oppressors. Part of the fun of writing him was the idea that in another story, if things had gone differently, he'd be the villain. But in this story, Kelsier is the hero, and it's because he's able to channel his being a psychopath into a noble cause, but still, there's a danger behind Kelsier's eyes that might let him survive in Westeros better than a lot of my other characters."

      "Yes.\r\nELEANOR\r\nBrandon looked a bit uncomfortable/hesitant answering this one. Not sure I should have warned him it was a Terez one, but he answered all the same. Theories, anyone? ALSO: Followup question asked Sun 22. Can someone ask how the stone got there? Was it dragged by teams to where it was safe to gateway?\r\nFOOTNOTE�TEREZ\r\nThis question was also asked by another person. I was going to ask about the stone that Taim used as his podium, a symbol of his office, beginning in Lord of Chaos, but I figured the description was too complicated for a question I had to pass on to be asked by someone else. I was thinking everything at the Black Tower was made with that same rock, so I said to ask about Taim's palace. Turns out only the walls are made out of that rock, and the original podium is still used as a podium in the palace. The palace is white marble, though it has black stone columns. Brandon probably knew the walls were made out of Shayol Ghul rock, and assumed I knew what I was talking about with the palace. (I didn't.) I didn't expect him to answer the question with a 'yes', or I might have put more effort into looking it up first. So we can probably assume that the podium and the walls are made of Shayol Ghul rock, and possibly also Moridin's Blightfortress and the Towers of Midnight in Imfaral. The significance is probably mostly symbolic, like the red-and-black floor tiles in Taim's palace."

      "Anyway, Tamyrlin will be posting a much more in-depth write-up of the questions and answers from that night, so I won't write any of that here. Brandon had also brought just three things with him (that I could tell). An ARC (advanced reader copy) of The Way of Kings which was to be given out to a lucky winner as a prize and two of his special decks of Magic: The Gathering cards that he hoped to be able to use in a game or two before the event.\r\n\r\nWe also had several other cool prizes donated by various people, including Tor (thanks for the bumper stickers and goodies!!), Inkwing.com (those t-shirts ROCKED, thanks guys for this!�checkout their site for awesome BWS paraphernalia), Theoryland, and the BYU Bookstore (thank you guys too).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the prizes were lying out on a table and, sadly, someone stole the ARC of The Way of Kings right off of the prize table!! The one thing that Brandon himself brought to give away to a lucky fan, and it was stolen. I was saddened that someone who likely calls him/herself a \"fan\" did that! I felt for a moment that whoever did that made all of us, as fans look bad. Then I decided that that thief is not a true fan anyway, so it doesn't affect me. I�m still angry about it though and I could tell Brandon was disappointed too when he found out. I hope it will be returned!"

Help?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I have no clue why Brandon and Harriet chose to be in Minnesota on release day (after a midnight release in Utah) but OMG THANKS for that, it was a really fun experience. It was the same spot I met George Martin some time ago.\r\n\r\nWhen I met George, I was way too starstruck to say anything, so I knew I had to be prepared for Brandon, a far less intimidating figure. I went with a casual, \"Assuming you have any free time, what have you been reading lately?\"\r\n\r\nHe responded with a funny anecdote about something recent he just picked up and was reading on the plane...but he thought it was pretty poor and didn't want to share the name or author, haha.\r\n\r\nThen, really quickly at the end, he said that the last thing he read was Fire Upon the Pond by Someone or Other. Yeah, I totally missed the author, but I thought I would be good with the title. I came away with words \"Fire\" and \"Pond\" for sure, but google searches reveal nothing...I have tried googling for a list of his favorite books and nothing I found helped.\r\n\r\nReddit, I give to you this quest. Do not fail me!\r\n\r\nEDIT: I didn't make this clear, but he mentioned this book was one of his favorites, which is why I was looking for lists of his favorite books, AND why I think someone here might know it (instead of just shooting in the dark).\r\n\r\n\r\ngze\r\nI think it's A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge based on his twitter.",

      "Just a quick question . . . I purchased Mistborn 3 signed from Sam Weller's (and just ordered my Warbreaker signed copy as well). Are you going to offer signed and numbered copies of The Gathering Storm? I read your blog pretty regularly, but may have missed you already addressing this question. If so, sorry!",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I think I've mentioned the possibility, Dave, but never given anything firm. Well, I've been doing some asking, and it seems that Harriet and Tor are all right with this. So, I'm about 95% sure that this is going to happen with the The Gathering Storm. We'll probably do signed/personalized/numbered editions from Sam Weller's by mail AND will do a release party at BYU Bookstore again. The release party will probably be a midnight release, followed by me flying to Charleston to do another event in the evening of the release day.\r\nI can't say how many books we'll release to Sam Weller's to sell this way. The numbered editions I do at these release parties aren't to replace the leatherbound collector's editions that Tor does. (I think they're doing one for The Gathering Storm, though I don't know.) My numbered editions have no cap�I number as many, generally, as there are people. (Note that Sam Weller's still has some Warbreaker copies that I'm going to go in and personalize for people tomorrow, so if you want one, give them a call.) Mostly, the numbers are just to say \"Hey, I got the book from one of the release events. Isn't that cool?\" But I could see so many being requested from Sam Weller's that we have to cap it to save my hand (and my sanity.)\r\nAnyway, that's a long way to say yes, Dave. Keep an eye on the blog. We'll try to get the announcements for these events up earlier than we did for Warbreaker."

There is an underlying theme behind them all and an underlying deeper story that is going on behind the scenes with some big theological components. It's within the thematic nature of the complete series—one that will eventually be told, assuming I live long enough. And if not, I'll leave good notes, so someone else can finish it!

Would it be a good thing or a bad thing? I came up with a world where people become what I call Epics.

He said that they're not terrible, but they definitely are shown as somewhat more common than they really are.  But he also said that they're not nearly as rare as people seem to think; for example, he stated that virtually everyone would know at least one Coinshot.  So there are definitely a lot of Allomancers around.\r\n\r\nAnd the occurrence of Twinborn would not be a normal statistical spread (alas).  As folks opined before in this thread, the Terris folk do tend to keep somewhat to themselves, so there's not a huge amount of population mix.  So Twinborn will be rarer.\r\n\r\nI did point out that there had to be some mix, else we'd be seeing full Feruchemists around, and to that he mostly just smiled and looked mysterious.  As he does.

There was a reader who brought me a handmade blown-glass pen they had made. Another one brought me a Tar Valon mark coin that they had minted or forged and gave it to me. Pictures, paintings, gifts for the baby, cookies (in one case, shaped like the seals on the Dark One's prison,) and Magic Cards (which are an addiction of mine) are among the gifts I was given.\r\n\r\nThings like that were very moving.

One was an Australian Military history (because of RJ's own passion for such matters) and the other was a Two Rivers wine, from the Two Rivers, in Hunter Valley, NSW.\r\nI left the theatre before it ended, so I could be first in line for the signing. Being there early, only another rep and Harriet, RJ's wife, were present. I spent a few minutes chatting with her, before the rest of the crowd and RJ appeared. I did learn something interesting from her; she remembered my insistence on the Rand-Elayne issue, and told me that to her and RJ second cousins were considered close family. Also, she and the rep got into a small argument over personalising the signings, with the rep saying there were too many people to personalise it, while Harriet argued on our behalf, that we had paid $20 to come, and we should. Eventually, she won out, at least for the first 20 people. I don't know what happened after that. I got three books signed, and left soon after.\r\nOne thing I asked Harriet while RJ was signing was about their stay in Sydney. I'm strongly tempted to go to the places they plan on visiting, but I suppose that is on the verge of stalking. Basically, they're staying here until the 4th, when they go to New Zealand. After that, they're going to Brisbane, but she was not sure about the exact date. So you Brisbanites will have to ring up Penguin Books and find out for yourself. And for those who did not want to pay the $20, you should know that they stopped checking at the door during the signing, so anybody could have gone in and gotten their books signed.\r\nThat's it, seeya."

Also curious as to why it didn't show up until the final draft.\r\n\r\nMRJackson@235\r\n\r\nWe didn't talk about it, but I can ask him.

      "I've had some emails from Harriet and company and can give you some more solid facts here.\r\nFirst, an email Harriet said I could post:\r\nDear Brandon,\r\nWhatever the \"art\" is that was posted on Dragonmount, I have not seen it, and from what I hear I would certainly not approve it.\r\nRest assured, no art will go on the cover until I have seen it and approved it. Best, Harriet\r\nThis was before Harriet saw the link on Dragonmount itself, showing the thumbnail of the artwork. The fact that she hadn't yet seen the real cover art makes this all seem even more fishy to me. Looking closely, that posted art really lacks detail. After getting some internal emails from Tor, I'm really thinking that my conclusion last night was true. This is not the cover, but a rough mock-up done quickly by production to have something to show at meetings. It was never supposed to go outside of Tor, and is NOT the final cover, not even close to it. I'll bet this is just a sketch Mr. Sweet did showing potential cover ideas. It might not even be him doing the art�it's too small to tell.\r\nTor is planning a press release about A Memory of Light talking about the title, the number of volumes, and that sort of thing. We won't see it until early next week, however, because of issues of timing with the major news sources. They moved it up from late in the week to early in the week, but that's the best they could do. Until then, don't panic. There is truth to some of the rumors, but there is also a lot of bad information going around.",

I would say that the things that struck me most were in the early days of my career, after I published Elantris. That book is about, in part, people who wounds continue to hurt, and the pain doesn't fade. Their bodies are broken; healing doesn't work on them any longer. I once got a very nice email, a year or so after it was published, from someone who was dealing with cancer, who thanked me for writing this book and said it was a metaphor for what it's like to deal with a chronic illness like cancer. Now, I hadn't gone into this book thinking, \"I'm going to write a book about a metaphor for people with cancer,\" and yet, the poignancy and power of this letter really drove home to me the strength that a story can have for each individual reader, when they adapt it to their own circumstances.

But it was me drawing on various sources, and also just trying to make my own thing. Yes, there�s certainly a Norse aspect to a lot of the weather magic and things like that, but it�s more that I wanted to tell a story about a world that got hit by these magical hurricanes every few days. Weather being such a force is going to therefore be an aspect of the religion, the belief systems, and the day-to-day workings of the people who live in that world. So it was partially natural outgrowth and partially my love and fondness for things that I�ve read."

      "You have really broken the mold and steered away from the usual races of the fantasy genre, is there any major reason why you avoided the standard tropes, such as elves and orcs?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "A couple of reasons. Those are really two questions. Why did I avoid the standard tropes? For a long time I've felt that epic fantasy has relied too much on Tolkien, who did a wonderful job, but I feel that rather than doing what he did by creating races and mythologies and worlds of our own we've in some ways allowed ourselves to be strongly influenced by him and relied on some of the work he did. In other cases those tropes have just been overplayed and overdone by people who were very good writers and knew what they were doing. I certainly don't want to point any fingers at people like Stephen Donaldson who wrote brilliant books making use of some of the familiar tropes from Tolkien, but one of the things to remember is that when he did that they weren't familiar tropes. They were still fresh and new. The same can be said for Terry Brooks. I'm sure if I were writing back then that's what I would have done too, because we were still exploring the genre and trying to decide where it was going to go and what epic fantasy was and meant. But I feel that I belong to the generation after that. There was the generation who relied a lot on Tolkien and the generation who grew up reading those authors' books, and a lot of us in my generation of writers seem like we are reacting against the previous generations by saying, \"Okay, that's been done, and you did a good job. Where else can we take this?\" I have no interest in writing about elves or dwarves or any of these things that have been explored for the last four decades in intricate detail. I want to go my own directions.\r\n\r\nBut personally, why do I include the races that I include? I'm just looking for interesting things that complement the story that I'm telling. The races in The Way of Kings come directly into the story and the mystery of what's happened before. If you pay close attention to what the races are, it tells you something about what's going to happen in the future and what's happened in the past. It's very conscious. This is just me trying to explore.\r\n\r\nI feel that epic fantasy as a genre has not yet hit its golden age yet. If you look at science fiction as a genre, science fiction very quickly got into extrapolating very interesting and different sorts of things. Fantasy, particularly in the late '90s, feels like it hit a bit of a rut where the same old things were happening again and again. We saw the same stories being told, we saw the same races show up, we saw variations only in the names for those races. For me as a reader, it was a little bit frustrating because I read this and felt that fantasy should be the genre that should be able to do anything. It should be the most imaginative genre. It should not be the genre where you expect the same stories and the same creatures. If we want to approach the heights of great storytelling and take it a few more steps so that we don't just copy what Tolkien did, we do what Tolkien did, which is look to the lore ourselves and build our own extrapolations. This is playing into what I like as a reader and my own personal philosophies and hobby horses, but it really just comes down to what I think makes the best story."

      "Although this doesn't have anything to do with the ideas presented in this thread, I can't really justify starting a new thread for a simple comment...\r\n\r\nI must say, that I was extremely disappointed with my meeting of RJ at a book signing in San Diego on the 8th.\r\n\r\nI got there about 1 hour before he was to start signing books. When I went inside to purchase my book ahead of time, he was already in there, and was doing an interview for the local news station. I met a few people there, and waited for 4:00pm to roll around. We all got in line (We were assigned numbers in the order we purchased the book—I was #24.), and waited for our turn to see the man.\r\n\r\nTurns out that he was not taking any questions during the signing. He was also not personalizing any of the books—so \"he could get out of there quicker\". (As I was told by a staff member at the book store.) I was disappointed by this, as I had heard that he usually takes a few questions during the book signings, and I had heard that he was a genuinely nice guy. When I got up there, I said \"Good Afternoon.\", and held my hand out to shake his hand. He ignored my hand, and asked for my books. He signed them, and that was it. Not a single word from him at all.\r\n\r\nI was miffed, to say the least, so I left right after that. He might have done something for the fans after all of the books were signed, but by everyone at the store's, and his, attitude, I doubt it. Maybe he had an appointment to go somewhere, or his flight was scheduled soon after the book signings. But regardless, I was extremely put off by his, and the store's, attitudes about this signing.\r\n\r\nI'd like to put some of the blame on the store, but I was there when Terry Goodkind's last book came out for his signing�Mr. Goodkind was extremely nice and talkative, and he took about 5-10 minutes with each person in line. (I was 5th in line that night, and it took me 45 minutes to get to him!) Not that I was complaining, though... Therefore, I can't say that RJ's signing was caused by the store pushing him out of there; the choice must have been all on RJ's part, and that ticks me off. Especially since he's my favorite author. I'm not going to stop reading or anything, I just wanted to throw this out there, and get it off my chest.\r\n\r\nAnyone out there have any experiences similar to this? Or did I just happen to see him for my first time on a \"bad day\"?\r\n\r\n—John"

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "In part, they stem from the underlying cosmology and overarching rules, the dictates of the magic systems of my shared universe. I was looking for a manifestation of that in Roshar. I also was searching for something that would give Roshar a different feel from things that I'd done before. I wanted this book and this series—and everything about it—to feel different from fantasy worlds in the past. I wanted it to be fantastical, but I wanted it to be unique. I wanted something that could consistently remind the reader, \"Oh, I'm in a different place. Wow. Their emotions manifest visibly when they feel them strongly. This place is bizarre.\" That was one of the main inspirations. Looking in our world, one inspiration is certainly the Eastern concept in Shinto mythology of everything having a soul, every rock and river and tree having something living inside of it that is a manifestation of it. Since I was working with the idea of Platonic realms and the like, I spun that off into the spren."

That would be something for the outriggers, which maybe we can get into the encyclopedia. He left a big list for everyone and a number for their power level, their strength in the One Power, just for comparison's sake, which was cool because it would also say 'Here's the threshold for creating a gateway and here's the threshold for this' and its a really cool list and I hope they put it into the encyclopaedia but I don't know if they will.\r\n\r\nPrncRny\r\nOk, so she's not going to snap in the next one and start channeling?\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\nWell.

      "I don't know if I can really cover that one in this particular response. It's a big topic. The short answer, however, is to follow these steps. 1) Write the book. 2) Research publishers based on those who publish books in that genre. Look for publishers who publish books with similar themes and tropes as your own. Then, research those publishers, find out their submission guidelines, and submit to them. Also, you may want to consider researching agents and submitting to them. Be careful; there are a lot of disreputable agents out there. Be looking for agents (and publishers) who do not charge a reading fee, and who represent authors you've heard of. A quick rule of thumb is that if an agent (or their umbrella agency) has not sold a book by a newer author to a major publisher in the last year or two, they probably aren't worth your time. If you want to learn more, head over to my podcast at WritingExcuses.com and listen to the several podcasts we've done with editors."

Melanie Rawn is a great author, I especially like her epic fantasy, I haven't read her urban fantasy but Dragon Prince is one of my favorite books of all time.

There WILL be more info about Towers of Midnight too, but I'll probably be holding off on that for a while. I know you're hungry for more information. I'll give you what I can, but I've been asked to be more secretive about these books than I normally am, and (as I have said before) I feel it is respectful to keep to Harriet's wishes.\r\n\r\n(Progress on Towers of Midnight is going well, but this is—in many ways�a much BIGGER book than The Gathering Storm. There are a lot more viewpoints and plots to wrangle, including many people who were not seen in The Gathering Storm. The Gathering Storm was very focused by intention and design. Towers of Midnight is going to feel very different, as we're going to be expanding the scope a little to include all of the things we need to see to get ready for the Last Battle.

I'm about forty percent of the way through the first draft; the problem is never first draft, though; revisions take a long time on a book this big. Rothfuss once described it as, \"It's like ninety percent awesome, but you don't want to release something that's only ninety percent awesome, and that last ten percent is really hard to get to sometimes.\" So we'll see.\r\n\r\nHarriet McDougal\r\n\r\nAnd then, production on an enormous book is also very time-consuming, and the way I think of it is, there will be Gelusil on coffee carts at Tor, or other remedies for stomach upsets. They say, \"You want this book by when?\"\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson\r\n\r\nTom, who runs Tor, is optimistic, though I noticed he had little stickers�there's copies of Way of Kings to give out as prizes, and they have a sticker on it that says, \"Watch for the sequel in late 2013.\""

      "I had my 1990 Tor hardback version of The Eye of the World signed, but I was chagrined to realise that other people were getting two or three books signed. Oh well.\r\nFinally, I would like to say that RJ seemed like a very polite and patient man, who was generous with his time. We probably annoyed the hell out of him asking him questions after the talk, and even though half the answers were RAFO, he made an attempt to answer each sensible one.\r\nHarriet sat next to him during the signing, and seemed to me to be a very polite and forthcoming person. I can believe she is the model for the better qualities in RJ's female characters, but I had no inkling of the darker ones, but it was clear that in many matters RJ defers to her and respects her judgement.\r\nRJ and Harriet had just returned from New Zealand (RJ had been fishing) and their schedule seemed pretty hectic. Next stop for them was Lizard Island, and I assured Harriet that they would have the time of their lives there.\r\nApart from the drunk idiot sitting a couple of seats down from Joel and I during RJ's talk, everything went very well and I think everyone had a very good evening.\r\n--\r\nWillum"

Sherri has some great examples from her own experience, so check it out.\r\n\r\nThe newest Warbreaker annotation covers the shortest chapter in the book. I considered making this the longest annotation, but decided against it. It's still much longer than the chapter itself."

      "The book's release is getting closer, folks. Are you excited yet?\r\n\r\nDragonmount has announced the Tower Guard program for the upcoming book tour, similar to the Storm Leaders program from last year. Basically, this is an opportunity for a few hardcore fans in each city to spend some personal time with Harriet and me, in exchange for helping out at the signing. I had a great time with the Storm Leaders last year, and I look forward to it again this year. If you're interested in the opportunity, Dragonmount's application is right here.\r\n\r\nI've also put up a page explaining how to get signed & numbered copies of Towers of Midnight. For those who can't attend a signing during the tour, pay close attention to the section on the Sam Weller's signing by mail. There's an important addition to that this time: For no additional shipping cost, you can buy another book to be delivered in the same box, such as a second copy of Towers of Midnight, or a copy of The Gathering Storm or The Way of Kings. (Only Towers of Midnight will be numbered, but I'll sign and personalize the other books too.)\r\n\r\nOn the same page, details on the numbering system for the midnight release are there too. If you went to the Way of Kings release it will work pretty much the same way, but there are a few changes from how it worked at last year's The Gathering Storm release. Plus they have some cool things planned for the release party. Check it out."

      "Ok, I suppose I'll start on the job. How did you come to edit for Jim? Did it just fall into place due to your respective jobs, or was it something you had to discuss first?",

      "It fell into place as follows: When we met I was editing my own imprint, and I gave him his first publishing contract. It was for the Fallon historical novels: The Fallon Blood, The Fallon Pride, and The Fallon Legacy. We worked on The Fallon Blood all the way through publication before we ever went on a date�so the editor/writer relationship is the older one. We simply found that we worked very well together."
