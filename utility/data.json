      "The question segment ended and Brandon sat down to start signing books. I was talking to several people around me when I heard, 'Is there a poster named Samadai from Tor.com here?' Needless to say I was shocked to hear someone announce that, I turned around raised my hand and said, \"that's me\". Well the Powell's book store worker said to me, \"well we have Forkroot from Tor.com right over here.\" I looked over to see him waving at me, he came over and told me how he ended up there (which he talked about in his posting). As forkroot mentioned we also collected a gathering of people to talk to.",
      "They called the ticket holders up 10 people at a time and so I was in the third group of people near the end of the line #28\\. When I was at the front of the line I introduced myself to Brandon. I told him my screen name at Tor.com said I heard He at met Freelancer at another signing, he remembers you. I then mentioned that we all had come of with some more questions for him and were wondering if he had time. He told me to stick around to the end and he would spend some time with us (I told him about Forkroot as well). Done with my time, I went back and hung out with Forkroot and the others, where we discussed all the same things we all discuss on here. Forkroot then had his turn. After he was done there were a few more people, and then the Storm Leaders had the picture and signings. Forkroot and I had our picture taken with Brandon, then we all went outside after profusely thanking the Powell's store staff, and enviously thanking the Storm Leaders.",
      "Out in front of the store, Forkroot, myself and a couple of our new friends gathered around Brandon. Forkroot asked his questions first which he already posted [up there at 2535](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2009/10/the-wheel-of-time-the-gathering-storm-review-with-spoilers#75210). Then we got down to the questions that you guys gave me.",
      "I arrived at about 5:30 and was about the 30th person there (one of the gentlemen I ended up talking to most of the night had been there since 10:00am). Another girl had driven 600 miles from central Idaho to come to the signing. Her father had come with her and walked up to Brandon and thanked him for making his daughter's night. Brandon got up and shook both their hands."

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I generally like them. There are some that I'm less fond of; there are some that I like more. I haven't ever been terribly fond of the _Alcatraz_ covers in the U.S. I actually think that the German covers of the _Alcatraz_ books are much stronger. Those would probably be my least favorite of them all, but in general I really like what artists are doing and how they're working to interpret my worlds.",
      "It's nice to see, as a writer, someone taking what you've written and envisioning it in a sometimes new and different way, making something cool and creative out of it. So I'm generally very pleased. It's very cool to see how different cultures and different publishers react to the same text and the different types of stories that they convey just through the pictures they put on the front.",
      "When Moshe bought _Elantris_ and wanted to follow it up with another novel, I first offered him _The Way of Kings_ but we realized that it was too ambitious a project at that point in time. So instead I took concepts from three of those failed novels and rewrote them into the first Mistborn book, writing it at the length my natural style seemed to work best at. And Mistborn was a huge success.",
      "You shouldn't assume that when you've read one Brandon Sanderson novel, you know what the next one is going to be like. From one series to the next I like to try different things. I know that some readers who really liked Mistborn are not going to like _The Way of Kings_; Mistborn had a narrower scope and faster pace than a huge epic like _The Way of Kings_ has, and if a reader prefers that sort of book that is perfectly okay with me. I am going to write some books that are fast-paced and others that are huge epics. I like to change things up."

      "On the second day he read from a new novel set in the _Elantris_ world (though in a whole different part of the world, with completely new characters (barring, of course, Hoid)). I didn't write it down, but the title was something like 'Soul of the Dragon Emperor'. The magic system involves Forgers, people who can through study and understanding something's past, forge a soulseal which can change that past so long as it is touching the thing itself. So a Forger could look at an old and battered table, and by studying it—understanding where the wood came from, where the polish came from, so forth—they could then create a soulseal that says the table has been lovingly and carefully cared for, and so long as that seal is laid into the table, the table will no longer be battered and old, but perfectly polished. This is the gist of the plot as well, that something has happened to the Emperor and a talents Forger who works as a thief is supposed to Forge the Emperor's soul so that it appears as if nothing has happened.",

I did learn something interesting from her; she remembered my insistence on the Rand-Elayne issue, and told me that to her and RJ second cousins were considered close family. Also, she and the rep got into a small argument over personalising the signings, with the rep saying there were too many people to personalise it, while Harriet argued on our behalf, that we had paid $20 to come, and we should. Eventually, she won out, at least for the first 20 people. I don't know what happened after that. I got three books signed, and left soon after.",

      "How did the idea germinate and come to fruition for the gem-studded magic system of _The Way of Kings_?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "One of the things to keep in mind is I that developed this book before Mistborn was published. I do wonder if sometimes people are going to say, \"Oh, he did metals before, and now he's doing crystals.\" But the thoughts arose quite independently in my head. You may know that there is a unifying theory of magic for all of my worlds'a behind-the-scenes rationale. Like a lot of people believe there's unifying theory of physics, I have a unifying theory of magic that I try to work within in order to build my worlds. As an armchair scientist, believing in a unifying theory helps me. I'm always looking for interesting ways that magic can be transferred, and interesting ways that people can become users of magic. I don't want just to fall into expected methodologies. If you look at a lot of fantasy'and this is what I did in Mistborn so it's certainly not bad; or if is, I'm part of the problem'a lot of magic is just something you're born with. You're born with this special power that is either genetic or placed upon you by fate, or something like that. In my books I want interesting and different ways of doing that. That's why in _Warbreaker_ the magic is simply the ability to accumulate life force from other people, and anyone who does that becomes a practitioner of magic.",
      "In _The Way of Kings_, I was looking for some sort of reservoir. Essentially, I wanted magical batteries, because I wanted to take this series toward developing a magical technology. The first book only hints at this, in some of the art and some of the things that are happening. There's a point where one character's fireplace gets replaced with a magical device that creates heat. And he's kind of sad, thinking something like, \"I liked my hearth, but now I can touch this and it creates heat, which is still a good thing.\" But we're seeing the advent of this age, and therefore I wanted something that would work with a more mystical magic inside of a person and that could also form the basis for a mechanical magic. That was one aspect of it. Another big aspect is that I always like to have a visual representation, something in my magic to show that it's not all just happening abstractly but that you can see happen. I loved the imagery of glowing gemstones. When I wrote Mistborn I used Burning metals'metabolizing metals'because it's a natural process and it's an easy connection to make. Even though it's odd in some ways, it's natural in other ways; metabolizing food is how we all get our energy. The idea of a glowing object, illuminated and full of light, is a natural connection for the mind to make: This is a power source; this is a source of natural energy. And since I was working with the highstorms, I wanted some way that you could trap the energy of the storm and use it. The gemstones were an outgrowth of that."

      "sir",
      "you pay over in that line over there.\"\r\nCamel: \"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nI walked over to where pointed",
      "and there was another line that was a good 30 minutes long. So I finally paid my $85 for my 4-day pass",

      "sir.\"\r\nGuy: \"Yeah",
      "I thought so too.\"\r\n\r\nFinally he shuts up and enters my information. I wait about 5 minutes for them to print out the badge",
      "I triumpantly take it from the desk clerk person",
      "and haul @#%$ out of the room. I called SP:\r\n\r\nCamel: \"All right",

      "like a gorilla who thinks he's about to get a banana. I said \"Hey",
      "yeah",
      "I'm Camel.\" and he goes \"I FOUND HIM!\" and alluva sudden there's like 30 people! (okay",
      "7) surrounding me. I immediately recognize Zaela",
      "Hopper",
      "and Isabel. Tamyrlin and WSB kept running their mouths at me like we had been in some sort of conversation that got interrupted. I'm not quite sure what they said",
      "but it must've been interesting. I was too busy adjusting to the shock of the company of 7 people I knew",
      "but had never met. If that makes any sense at all.\r\n\r\nSo then SP takes control of the situation (scary",
      "I think) and leads us all back to the hotel",
      "which was a Travelodge about a block away from the Hilton and Marriott. We packed into Zaela's room",
      "and discussed where we were going to go next",
      "and what the sleeping arrangements would be. I wasn't really paying attention there",
      "either. I was focusing on trying to get used to not hearing a southern accent",
      "which is harder than it seems. Finally",
      "we start walking towards a bar that SP had recommended",

      "I notice my badge is no longer clipped onto my shorts. So I stop and look for a few minutes",
      "because Tam had made a motion like something had dropped a few dozen feet back",
      "so I went back there to see if that's what had dropped. No dice. My badge was gone. I figured I'd go replace it later",
      "since I had my photo ID and all my information was in the computer systems anyway. So we continued upon our way.\r\n\r\nTam walked beside me on the way there and asked a lot of questions",
      "like where I'm from and what I'm doing in school and stuff. It was nice to talk about something I knew (myself) and not have to focus on figuring out what the hell is going on (which is 95% of the time). So",
      "thanks Tam.\r\n\r\nWe got to the Max Lager",
      "and we had this goofy looking",
      "funny as hell waiter that was awesome. He was great. We got some sort of sampler platter. I tried very patiently to wait for everyone to get a couple peices of whatever",
      "and once everyone seemed satisfied with whatever they had gotten",
      "I grabbed the rest. What? I was hungry",
      "okay? SP noticed this with great amusement.\r\n\r\nI also got a video clip of Zaela downing whatever drink she had. It was kinda funny."

I think my session is filled up, but there might be other authors you can work with. Conferences like this one are expensive, but can really give you a leg up if you're wanting to break into publishing.",

It's still odd that the promotional Mistborn 1 and Mistborn 2 paperbacks still have no cover art posted, but whatever.",

He said that they're not terrible, but they definitely are shown as somewhat more common than they really are. But he also said that they're not nearly as rare as people seem to think; for example, he stated that virtually everyone would know at least one Coinshot. So there are definitely a lot of Allomancers around. And the occurrence of Twinborn would not be a normal statistical spread (alas). As folks opined before in this thread, the Terris folk do tend to keep somewhat to themselves, so there's not a huge amount of population mix. So Twinborn will be rarer. I did point out that there had to be some mix, else we'd be seeing full Feruchemists around, and to that he mostly just smiled and looked mysterious. As he does.

      "I am curious if professional writers ever get psyched out by their own works. When you are working on an epic series, such as The Stormlight Archive, do you ever have moments of doubt in your ability to see it through to completion? Does it ever feel overwhelming that you have so many volumes ahead of you to write?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "That's not the part that psychs me out. Length doesn't do that to me, particularly when I have a series well planned and I have a feel for how each book is going to be distinctive. This really helped me with the Mistborn series, for instance—when I planned it out, I planned each book to have its own identity. That kept me interested in them.",
      "No, what psychs me out is that sometimes something just turns out really well, like _The Way of Kings_, and then I immediately start thinking, \"I have to do that again, and I don't know how I did it in the first place.\" Writing becomes a very instinctive thing.",
      "Most of the time when I talk about the process of writing, I'm analyzing what I've done after the fact. The truth of it is that right in the moment, right when you're sitting there working on a book, a lot of that stuff isn't going through your head. You're just running on instinct at that point. So it's easy to get psyched out when you're not sure if you can ever do it again.",

      "So when you come to events like this and you sit on the panels, do you do it more so the fans can understand you more as a writer or do you do it to help out young aspiring writers and try to give them some tips and tricks?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "You know, it's a little bit of both. When I was young—I was 17—I went to my first convention and Katherine Kurtz was there and she sat down with me. And I was just a young, teenage, aspiring writer, and she talked to me for a good half hour on the business, how to write, and other advice. I've remembered that ever since, and I thought if I ever get in this position where I can do the same thing, I want to be available.",
      "Becoming a writer, so much of it is solitary. You have to spend all this time sitting, writing on your own, and practicing that when you can actually connect with someone who has gone there before, it can mean more than basically anything else in your writing career—save just practicing. So I like to be available.",
      "I'm at this place in my career where my fans support me. They read the books and that makes it possible for me to do what I do, and I want to be available for them. I use the metaphor that—I guess it's more of a simile—you're like the people in the 19th century. If you wanted to be an artist you had to find a wealthy patron to take care of you. And my wealthy patron is the fandom, right? I exist with them supporting me actively. I mean these sci-fi and fantasy fans are well connected. They can all go pirate the books—they all know how to. But instead they buy them and support me. So I want to be available."

      "What's the most surprising thing a reader or reviewer has said about your work?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "When you do something like I do, you live in a perpetual state of surprise. You spend years and years admiring the great authors who you've read and loved, and you dream of managing to pull it off yourself someday. When you do pull it off, you have a tendency to think, \"Is this me they're talking about? Really?\"",
      "It's hard to pick out just one that is the most surprising. I would say that the things that struck me most were in the early days of my career, after I published _Elantris_. That book is about, in part, people who wounds continue to hurt, and the pain doesn't fade. Their bodies are broken; healing doesn't work on them any longer. I once got a very nice email, a year or so after it was published, from someone who was dealing with cancer, who thanked me for writing this book and said it was a metaphor for what it's like to deal with a chronic illness like cancer. Now, I hadn't gone into this book thinking, \"I'm going to write a book about a metaphor for people with cancer,\" and yet, the poignancy and power of this letter really drove home to me the strength that a story can have for each individual reader, when they adapt it to their own circumstances. I would say that was something that left me in awe of this whole process."

My book tour starts tonight in New York and continues in Philadelphia, Denver, Omaha, New Orleans, Houston, San Jose, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Provo, and Spanish Fork. For details see my events page. (And note, as always I'm happy to sign any books you bring to a signing. Don't feel bad showing up to a signing for The Rithmatist carrying your copy of A Memory of Light. I'll sign it gladly. And if you want me to send you an email when I'll be signing near you, tell me your city [here](http://brandonsanderson.com/contact/?topic=9).)",
      "I'm super excited about _The Rithmatist_. Imagine a world where people duel using a magical, StarCraft-like system where one draws units and structures in chalk. Those come to life once you complete them, though they remain two dimensional, and you can use any drawing surface as a dueling platform. The main character, Joel, gets to go to a school specializing in this magic, though he can't actually use it himself. (He is the son of the cleaning lady, so he gets free tuition.) Students start disappearing, and he gets mixed up in the mystery.",
      "This book is a favorite among my beta readers. (_The Rithmatist_ has been around in draft form for some six years now, so many of the inner circle of my fans have read it already.) It's a fun, quick read that (hopefully) will tide you over while I'm finishing up Stormlight 2, _Words of Radiance_. (About 80% done with that right now.)",
      "While I love my Alcatraz series for younger readers, that series is very bizarre and quite different from the style of my adult books. I've found that many of my readers wish I had something more \"Brandonesque\" to hand to their younger siblings, children, nieces and nephews, etc. Well, this is the book for you. Deep worldbuilding, a complex magic system, and a sharp plot.",
      "Hopefully you'll all be willing to give it a look. The sample chapters are [here](http://www.tor.com/stories/2013/01/the-rithmatist-excerpt) and you can hear the beginning of the audiobook [here](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1162/).",

      "On the origins of the Mistborn series and his writing process:",
      "\"I'm always searching for ideas that I can connect into a larger story. I feel that a book is more than just one idea. A good book is a collection of ideas, a good idea for each character, something that forms the core of their conflict. Some ideas come from the setting, or something that's going to drive the economy, something that's going to, for me, drive the magic [system].\"",
      "Brandon continued to explain his process by demonstrating how the Mistborn series came together. \"I was watching the Harry Potter movies and I was thinking about The Lord of the Rings and while I like the idea of the hero's journey, I began thinking about how the dark lord in these stories gets the raw end of the deal. So I wanted to write a book where the dark lord wins. Although that's kind of a downer.\"",
      "Brandon explained that he shelved that idea until he could figure out how to make a story where the villain wins not be so bleak. \"It took me a little while to figure out what to with that idea. Then I was watching one of my favorite movies, _Sneakers_, and started thinking about how I hadn't seen an amazing heist story in fantasy ever. Little did I know Scott Lynch was going to release a great one only a year later!\"",
      "The two ideas combined, Brandon continued, \"like atoms that combine to create a molecule that's something different.\" The magic system in Mistborn was the same way, according to the author. Allomancy and Feruchemy were magic that had been designed for different worlds but worked really well together with the story of Mistborn.",
      "So Brandon set to work, filling out the gaps in the story by brainstorming along the way.",
      "One audience member noted that Brandon has a pattern of having his characters working towards a goal only to have that goal turn out to be the incorrect one, which prompted the author to discuss how he thinks of plot twists. \"To figure out a good plot twist you want the reader or viewer to be surprised that it happened and then, as it's happening, realize they should have seen it coming. You can't always pull that off but when you can they're really great and that's what I'm shooting for.\"",
      "\"I don't twist my plot just to twist it. My hope is that the more that is revealed, the more that you experience a hidden depth to the characters and their journeys. It's like life. Everyone you meet you make a snap judgment but then the more you get to know them the more depth they reveal. I want readers to experience that with my books. Part of why I like writing epic fantasies is because the story gives you the room to develop and explore that depth. Everything is about more than one thing.\""

There's an important addition to that this time: For no additional shipping cost, you can buy another book to be delivered in the same box, such as a second copy of _Towers of Midnight_, or a copy of _The Gathering Storm_ or _The Way of Kings_. (Only _Towers of Midnight_ will be numbered, but I'll sign and personalize the other books too.)",
      "On the same page, details on the numbering system for the midnight release are there too. If you went to the _Way of Kings_ release it will work pretty much the same way, but there are a few changes from how it worked at last year's _The Gathering Storm_ release. Plus they have some cool things planned for the release party. [Check it out](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/page/62/Towers-of-Midnight-Release-Events#item3)."

      "I actually have several that I want to do. My schedule's very packed; actually my next YA books are not humor; they're more adventurous. Well, I've got one that's more epic fantasy-ish, and one that's more adventurous. I do want to finish out the Alcatraz series; I actually bought it back from Scholastic, and bringing it to Tor, and then I'm going to finish it off. I also have a book I've wanted to write forever called \"Zeke Harbinger, Destroyer of Worlds\" which is about a young man who, whenever he visits a planet—it's a science fiction—for whatever reason the planet ends up blowing up. It's not really his fault, but there's like a nuclear catastrophe on one, or things like that—don't worry, people are getting evacuated—but whenever goes to a planet it blows up, and that's kind of his...the series is about, you know, each book you visit a planet, and for some reason it ends up exploding. So, you know, I have silly things like that that I want to do. \"Mulholland Homebrew's Sinister Shop of Secret Pets\", a little fantasy story about a girl who accidentally apprentices herself to a guy who runs a fantasy pet shop. You know, stuff like that. Weird things, it's what goes through my head. We'll see if I actually end up writing it.",

I can say, \"Is this true?\" I can pray. I can feel a confirmation, and it's repeatable. It's, every time I've wanted it, I've felt it. That's enough for me to go forward in faith right now. So, that's my version of a comment to you. I don't mind if you post that—I really don't; it's okay—but you know, I think we just do the best we can, and we soldier forward.",

I feel for a new writer, reading slush on a magazine can be really helpful because you see what some of the rookie mistakes are, being made by other people kind of in your same mode, your same skill set, and sometimes, when I did it as an aspiring writer, it taught me so much about what newer writers were doing, and things that I could avoid. It also helps to spend a little time around editors and see what's going through the minds of editors. Certainly a magazine is different from a book publication, but they share a lot of things, and it can be very helpful in teaching, so I suggest if there's a local fanzine—or a local semi-prozine, which is what the BYU magazine is, kind of, what the terminology is for it—go be a part; read some slush, and be part of the community, and see what other writers are doing.",

      "Did you move a lot of sections around during the development? It certainly seemed as though Kal's parts could go in a different order or start his story from the bottom and work out how he got there.",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Yes, I did move things around a lot, particularly between the first draft of this book in 2003 and this draft. Things have jumped around all over the place, and even at the last minute I was moving different things between parts. Dalinar moved around more than Kaladin did because I was trying to decide where I wanted his ending in part two to happen. I wanted each of the parts to have its own climactic sense, to have a good ending particularly for the characters who didn't continue in the next part, when Dalinar and Shallan were alternating. So there was a lot of juggling and trying to decide—for instance, the prelude was added very late in the process. I'd had the prologue and decided I needed a second prologue as the prologue to the series, which is where the prelude came from.",
      "Kaladin's entire sequence, with the flashbacks and things, was decided on early on, but remember I'd written this book once before. At the end of his flashback sequences, he makes a decision. Where this book deviates from the original I wrote in 2003 is that in the old version he actually made the opposite decision, and it happened in chapter one.",
      "Now we get to see flashbacks of him making the other decision, which works so much better. It's one of those things where I was beating my head against the wall for years trying to figure out how to make his character work. His character was the part of the original _The Way of Kings Prime_ that had not worked, and it took me years to figure out how to make his character work right. That one decision of his was the turning point."

      "Brent, I think you're absolutely right several places in there. (Though I feel like I should object on principle, so there's more conflict to our narrative. Good storytelling, and all that.)",
      "Yes, there are things I can get away with now that I couldn't before'or ones I didn't try to get away with before. One big one is flashbacks. In my early years as a writer, published and unpublished, I stayed far away from flashbacks. Partially because I'd been told to do so, and partially because I'd seen them done poorly from a large number of other new writers. There are good reasons to stay away from them, and the advice is good. If you do flashbacks the wrong way, you'll break the flow of your narrative, risk undermining the tension of your story, confuse the reader, and basically make a big old mess.",
      "Then Pat Rothfuss comes along and does a narrative-within-a-narrative where the entire book is basically flashback, and it works really well. I do know, however, that Pat had a lot of trouble selling that book of his to start. (Though admittedly, I'm not sure if that was the flashbacks or not. I seem to remember he added the frame story later in the process, and that the huge length of the book was what was scaring people away at first.)",
      "I guess this brings us back to the first rule of writing: you can do whatever you want, if you do it well. Regardless, I decided'after some deliberation'that I'd use flashbacks as an extensive device in _The Way of Kings_ and the rest of the series. None of these were in earlier drafts of the novel, however, because I knew that many readers (and editors) have a knee-jerk reaction against flashbacks because of how likely they are to screw things up. Now that I'm established, however, I feel that people will trust me when they see them.",
      "(One thing I'm leaving out is that I think I'm a better writer now than I was before, and if I'd tried these flashbacks during earlier days, I'd likely have flubbed them.)",
      "You talk about foreshadowing, and make some great points. One thing I think that I want to bring up is the idea of nesting reveals. I always try to have a nice spectrum of types of plot twists and revelations in the book. Some are easier to figure out, others more difficult. My experience has been that some readers want to try to guess what is going to happen, and others do not, but both appreciate a legitimate twist in the story. (One that was clearly foreshadowed, but not made obvious.) As so yes, there are going to be different types of readers, and some will see the foreshadowing that others will not. Some won't care at all if the story just twists unexpectedly (and without explanation) while others will consider it a put-downable offense.",
      "In the spirit of tossing questions back and forth, then, let me ask you this: I just mentioned above that you can do anything in your writing if you do it well. Yet I've also talked a lot about the importance of foreshadowing. What do you think? Is it ever justified to have a total _Deus Ex Machina_? (For those who don't know, this refers to a major plot twist'usually involving the heroes/protagonists being rescued from danger unexpectedly'that is not explained or foreshadowed.) How might one do this well? Or is it an exception to my rule? Is my rule even really a good rule?",
      "(Also, all, please forgive typos in this post. Just back from book tour after a long day traveling, and wanted to make sure I got this posted. But I'm kind of drooping here.)",
      "To paraphrase one of the commenters, if you dissect the magic too much, do you risk it dying on the table?",
      "*Maybe I'd put JK Rowling as an exception, arguing that eventually what she was writing was epic fantasy. And it did get better. Mostly.",
      "To use a less grandiose metaphor, I see this magic as a box of toys. I hope people will play with them and put them together in ingenious ways. Indeed, the enjoyment and the terror for me as a writer is feeling like I'm in a footrace with my own fans. Who's going to come up with the coolest uses of these luxins? Them, or me?",
      "It's an experiment, and I think that's one of the greatest things about fantasy. We get to play. And if we keep that sense of play, of fun, then the magic—and the stories themselves—will be wondrous.",
      "So on that note, Dane, thank you for having me on to talk about some of the things that I love. And Brandon, thanks for sharing your thoughts—and for swatting aside a few hand grenades. It's been a real pleasure talking with you. And to my fans out there, if you haven't already, Check this guy out. His books are great.",
      "Now after the city's saved or doomed, and you learn in the epilogue that the city was small potatoes and that the new king is going to cause serious trouble elsewhere, that—to my eyes—isn't a cliffhanger. This book was about X, and X got resolved. The next book is going to be about Y.",

Utah readers also tend to buy more fantasy and sf books than a lot of other states. My guess is that there are many things coming together to cause these trends.",
      "First off, I think LDS culture emphasizes learning and reading in general. We grow up reading from the scriptures, and our prophet speaks often about the importance of education. Because of this, I think that there are just a lot of very literate people in our culture—and that translates to more writers and more readers.",
      "Beyond that, fantasy has a tradition of having strong values (two of the most foundational authors in the genre are C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, who both dealt a lot with good against evil and used Christian themes in their writing.) Because of this, fantasy attracts religious people, I think. Even something as generally un-religious as Harry Potter deals with the tradition of the good and the pure struggling against the corrupt and the evil.",
      "Finally, I think that the LDS religion—despite what some detractors may say—is far more open and accepting of new thoughts and ideas than other religious cultures. To an LDS reader, the concept of other populated worlds isn't threatening.",
      "However, since you asked—as others have—hardbacks are very important to my genre. We don't sell in supermarkets very often, and even less often do we get into places like Sam's or Costco. That means we depend on the main bookstores, and the science fiction section sells a LOT less than other sections. (The romance section is 60% or so of the fiction market. Sf is around 6 or 7%.)",
      "So, we depend on smaller sales of more expensive books to provide our income. That's our business model. (At least, or the big thick fantasy books like mine. There are people who do sf/f paperbacks with larger print runs and are very successful.) For me, though, hardbacks are essentially the only way I make money.",
      "So, why we publish hardbacks is simple. Now, as to why you should buy hardbacks—or not—that's completely up to you. Some people simply prefer paperbacks because they are lighter and easier to read. That's fine! Don't feel guilty at all.",
      "And, I'll leave it at that."

      "Before the Ascension, why did the mists appear just as the Well was gaining power? Did they come out at other times?",
      "Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)",
      "This one is trickier. From what I got out of it, it's because the mists are a manifestaion of Preservation, and physical manifestations of Preservation (including Allomancers) are intended to do two things - stop Ruin, and protect the Well of Ascension. Which are kind of the same thing. So, when the Well was dormant, the mists didn't really have much to do. The Deepness form of the mists is a result of the conscious part of Preservation freaking out and trying to produce a way to protect the well, mostly by producing more Allomancers. That's why the mists do all the funky things in the Well of Ascension and Hero of Ages - they're trying to produce more Allomancers to combat Ruin.",

I was thinking everything at the Black Tower was made with that same rock, so I said to ask about Taim's palace. Turns out only the walls are made out of that rock, and the original podium is still used as a podium in the palace. The palace is white marble, though it has black stone columns. Brandon probably knew the walls were made out of Shayol Ghul rock, and assumed I knew what I was talking about with the palace. (I didn't.) I didn't expect him to answer the question with a 'yes', or I might have put more effort into looking it up first. So we can probably assume that the podium and the walls are made of Shayol Ghul rock, and possibly also Moridin's Blightfortress and the Towers of Midnight in Imfaral.

Honestly, I would rather not be lumped with either side! I try very hard in all of my books to create both interesting worlds and believable characters. If I had to choose just one, however, I would rather be on the side of the character writers because I think characters make better stories than worlds do. In my opinion a good book is a balance between character, setting, and plot with character being the most important of the three. You can have the coolest magic system in the world, but if readers don't care about the characters who are using that magic system, the book won't be very fun to read.",

Be aware, though, that it is against industry protocol to send a complete manuscript to more than one editor or agent. You can send query letters or partial manuscripts to several sources, but if someone asks for a full manuscript, that person must accept or reject it before you send it to anyone else. It is important to know and follow the submission guidelines for the places to which you send manuscripts."

They've gone over fundamentals and learned what those fundamentals need to be. They might think about that for a minute, but when they swing, it all just clicks and they swing at the ball.",

After the fact, you go back and look at it and revise it and try to figure out what you're doing wrong, but there's more instinct to this—instinct born of practice—than people assume.",
      "My goal is to create a story that is an enjoyable read because the characters are enjoyable. Then, after that, I like to go with my magic system and try and make something you've never seen before. But no amount of world building is going to succeed if the characters are bland."

Sort of like a director shoots a lot of film and then edits it into a coherent narrative later, I tend to overwrite on my first drafts'the language is more wordy than it needs to be, sometimes a character will come to the same realization multiple times as I'm working out where best to fit it in, that sort of thing. In my final draft I go in and trim out all the fat. We talked about this in an episode of Writing Excuses last year; if you're curious about the process, [give it a listen](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/08/08/).",
      "So the words I'm cutting in this draft aren't anything you're going to miss as a reader. Now, sometimes I will cut an entire scene or heavily rework a section, but that usually happens in earlier drafts than this. I do save the cut scenes in case they contain something I want to use somewhere else or just for posterity. In the Library section of the website I've included some [deleted scenes from _Elantris_, Mistborn 1, and Mistborn 2](http://brandonsanderson.com/library)'check those out if you want to understand why it's a good reason those scenes are gone. Long after _The Way of Kings_ is out, some of its cut scenes or early draft sections may end up on that page. We'll see."

      "While majoring in English at college, Sanderson took a job as a hotel receptionist, working the graveyard shift.",
      "The managers didn't mind if he wrote on the job. \"In fact, they were happy if I did, because that meant I wasn't falling asleep like the previous person they'd hired. So I wrote—oh gosh, it must have been nine or 10 novels over the course of five years.\"",
      "Sanderson was living one of the standard writer-learns-the-ropes stories—turning out book after book after book, finding his voice, finding the stories that mattered to him, and finding the self-belief to swallow the rejection letters. There were a lot of rejection letters. He made his way through the forest of fantasy and science fiction sub-genres, one at a time. \"I did a post-apocalyptic book, I did an epic fantasy, I did a comic fantasy, I did some cerebral science fiction, I did a short action adventure fantasy...\"",
      "No one wanted any of them. In frustration he tried to figure out what kind of books publishers were looking for, so he could write one.",
      "\"We call this chasing the market and it's a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea and I did it anyway. The next two books I wrote were the two worst I'd done. I mean, I'd learned something from all those unsold novels and technically they were okay, but they didn't have any soul, they were just dreadful books. I didn't even send them out.\"",
      "Instead he sat down and deliberately wrote something profligately, ridiculously unpublishable. \"I had to say okay, I'm a writer, I love it, this is what I do. Getting published is not the aim. Writing is the aim. So okay. I'm going to ignore what everybody's been telling me in these rejection letters. I'm going to write the biggest, coolest, baddest, most awesome fantasy epic I can. All these ideas that I've told myself are too big, that I'm going to have to put off using, I'm not going to put off any more. And I sat down and I wrote _The Way of Kings_. I sank everything into it. I created this awesome beast of a novel, and to be perfectly honest, my skill wasn't up to doing it justice at that point, but I gave it everything I had.\"",
      "<div>Sanderson laughed, and offered the publisher three smaller books instead. Those three books made his name, attracted a very scary phone call, and made _The Way of Kings_ a viable publishing proposition. But let's back up a little.</div>"

      "Seven or eight years ago, I was thinking about what I love in fantasy. My love of the fantasy genre is this sense of another world that really couldn't, but for a while, we pretend that it could. With a science background, (I started my academic life as a chemist) I like to imagine worlds where our fundamental laws of physics don't apply but other fundamental laws of physics do. And so, for me, I like \"magic\" to be a new branch of physics that only exists in these worlds. That sounds a little sterile. It's more sterile than I wanted to sound because I think science has this wonder to it, and as you discover and you learn, there's this beautiful sense of discovery.",
      "It's where the great discoveries of our age is happening and scientific. I love particularly the era at the turn of the 19th to 20th century. The feel the people had for science back then—I often find myself writing in my books during a similar era, an age you might call an enlightenment. That's really the Renaissance, a little post-Renaissance age of industry where people are discovering that the magic follows rules and laws.",
      "I have rules for myself about how to write my magic systems and these are really just storytelling rules. I call them Sanderson's Laws. I can't really go into depth in an article here. (I've done essays on them, you can Google them.) But they're really writing advice to myself. I call them Sanderson's Laws, not because I think everyone should follow them, but they are laws I follow myself.",
      "They have to do with things like properly laying the foreshadowing for my magic so the reader understands what it can do and looking and exploring the different aspects of what a magic can do rather than adding a ton of new powers. Taking one power and setting (to see) if I can really explore it in its depth, things like that."

Or, for something more big budget, I'd love to see a Morrowind style Mistborn RPG.)",

      "I'm starting a new weekly bonus content feature for the next few months as a bit of an experiment. Right now I'm writing the sequel to _The Way of Kings_, and I've recorded my writing process for one chapter using [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html) (which was provided to me by the folks at TechSmith). The chapter I've recorded is the new interlude featuring Rysn (who was in one of the interludes in the first book). I've split the recording up into multiple videos that I'm uploading to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxFySrqdi8E&hd=1). The first one is up now, and it covers the prewriting/outlining for the chapter. For now, the videos are in real time, but once they're all uploaded I'll make a high-speed version of the whole chapter for those of you who don't want to sit and watch my normal typing speed.",
      "Some of you are wondering if this video will have spoilers for Stormlight 2\\. As an interlude, it takes place away from most of the action of the rest of the book, so you shouldn't see more than hints. This first video has the interlude's outline in it, so it will partially spoil the rest of the videos, but you'll find that the outline is very sparse. It's probably more likely to make you more interested to read more than to spoil you for the rest.",
      "The main point of these videos is to show you my writing process, which is something I get a lot of questions about. Enjoy. Stormlight 2 should come out before Christmas if I can get the first draft finished in April. I'm working hard on it right now, so we'll see if that happens.",

But what does it mean, then, to know—you're talking about being a little alone, lonely, disconnected, whatever as a child, or as a young person—now knowing that you're writing and you're giving a similar gift to others and that connection. You know what it meant to you, Brandon Sanderson, when you were young. What does it mean to now be the giver of that, or the connector of those? How would you respond?",

And people say they read my books and they feel like they know me, and they kind of joke, 'Oh no, I don't really.' And I say, no, you do. It's there. If you're reading it, you're seeing me. And I remember when the first time I realized that I was doing what you just said—that I was doing for people what people had done for me—was when I started getting my first emails. And I had gotten one from someone who said to me, it was a young man, 'Your books are what made me start reading.' And it stomped me, it throws me, and it floored me, because I have trouble believing I belong on the shelf with all those writers that I grew up reading, because they're the masters and I'm just the journeyman. I got into this because of them. And that was the first moment where I froze, and I said, 'Oh, wow! It's happening. I mean, I'm part of this. It's a cycle. It's a circle. I'm giving back to what people gave to me.' It really was a strange and surreal moment, and I just sat and stared at the screen for a little while."

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I certainly did. The thing is, I'm not good with talking in accents myself—I can hear them in my head, but I'm atrocious at trying to do them. So while I was writing the book, I was thinking in the back of my mind, \"I really hope that poor Michael can pull this off.\" It was a lot of fun to write Wayne's accents. I'm writing in a world that isn't our world, but the Mistborn world is a bit of an Earth analogue. I intentionally used themes that make it an Earth parallel, which is different from my other worlds. So you can have a character who kind of has a light Cockney accent or something like that, but it's not our world so it can't exactly mimic that accent. So it's already a challenge in that respect. I do think Michael did a fantastic job.",

This is no different from my other works; in the Mistborn books I've had to do this often.

It's not simple, it's not like one sentence but you can map out how the magic all fits together in this kind of super theorem.",

      "Right, they wouldn't have any of the background. Thing is, some of the magic systems do cross worlds, and have before. And that has not happened obviously; you haven't really seen it. Right now _Liar of Partinel_ [an unpublished book 'ed] and Stormlight Archive share a magic system, because with the unifying theory of magic there's a certain number of things that magic can do, and there's a lot of different ones, but when they get similar they tend to work in the same way. So Lightweaving shows up in both books. I may change that for Liar of Partinel, but it's kind of integral to that book and it's kind of integral to Stormlight Archive right now too. This is one of the reasons why I had to decide to do either Dragonsteel or Stormlight Archive as the big epic.",

      "What can readers expect from the second volume of The Stormlight Archive? Any tentative title or release date?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I originally had titled the second book _Highprince of War_. I'm not sure if I will keep that title, depending on who its central character ends up being. With the Stormlight Archive, I am playing with the form of the epic fantasy novel in a way that's very exciting to me that I haven't done since _Elantris_. If you read _Elantris_, the form of that book was very important in how it developed, with its chapter triad system. The books in this series also have a very specific form. Each book will focus on one character. That character will get flashbacks exploring their past, to show you how they arrived where they are. But the book will progress the narrative for everyone. For instance, this book was Kaladin's book, and you got flashbacks for him. He will appear substantially in the next book, and you'll have lots of viewpoints from him, but it will be someone else's book and that character will get flashbacks. Each book will have one central character, with two or three major characters who have no flashbacks and not quite as much screen time—characters like Dalinar and Shallan in the first book, and to a lesser extent Adolin and Szeth.",
      "The other thing that will continue is the interludes. I really enjoyed including those in the book; I'm not sure what people will think of them, but most of them are essentially going to be short stories set somewhere in the world, that enhance the main narrative and show different aspects of the world without forcing you to follow yet another plotline. They're just quick one-offs. You'll see those between parts in all of the other books.",
      "Tentative release date? I have to finish _A Memory of Light_ first. I don't know how long that will take to write. In a perfect world, which is probably not going to happen, the ideal case is that I'm able to finish _A Memory of Light_ by around August of 2011, whereupon it gets published in November 2011 and I start Stormlight Two January of the next year and it's ready for publication in November 2012\\. That would be the ideal situation. I often do manage to hit the deadlines in ideal situations, but I'm not making any promises on this one. I'm thinking 2012 spring is more likely for _A Memory of Light_, but we'll see."

      "My question is about the creation of chapters. How do you organize a chapter itself and its place in the overall continuum of the story?",
      "Just began listening to your writing excuses podcast, btw. I learned about it thanks to Reddit. Great stuff!",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I organize a chapter by having a goal in mind. Usually, I have couple of goals. \"In this chapter, I want to accomplish X, Y, Z.\" Usually, they are small things. \"Introduce this character\" or \"Show these two people not getting along\" or \"reveal this little tiny secret about what is happening.\"",
      "I get three or four of those together, think about which viewpoint is going to be most interesting (usually, but not always, the person who is doing the most and discovering the most,) and try to pick a setting that—if it's not set already—will be different from nearby scenes. Then I go, trying to build a rise to a climax (however small) within that scene.",
      "That's how it is for most middle chapters. End chapters are different, where the pace grows more frantic, and I split scenes into smaller bits, jumping about to keep the pace feeling exciting.",

      "The Asmodean killer is revealed in _Towers of Midnight_. (Look in the glossary.)",
      "How long things cook depends on the project. Some, like _The Way of Kings_, cook for decades. Mistborn was a period of about 2-3 years. Others, like my children's series, are exercises in free writing with very little 'incubation' time give.",
      "As for the last question...sometimes, it's hard to pinpoint how things come together, even for a planner like myself. I often compare writing to playing music. Often, a musician gets to the point where they don't know why their fingers move as they do—through a great deal of training, they learn to just make it happen. Writers develop similar instincts, but for plot, character, and prose.",
      "#### Brandon Sanderson",
      "The concept of \"Hell\" being the feelings of guilt and let-down we feel for failing to do what we promised. We believe that God will reward each person with as much joy as possible in the next life. Indeed, we believe that people'after death'have chances still to learn, grow, and decide what to do with their own destiny.",
      "Many, many people who are not \"Mormon\" but who are good people will find their way to every bit of joy and heavenly glory as a member of the Church in this life. I dare say that there will be far more \"non-Mormons\" than \"Mormons\" in heaven, as it is defined. Joseph Smith taught, for example, that if a person lived their life in an exceptional way, but was never taught the Gospel, they will not be punished for what they could not learn.",
      "Life'existence'is seen as a progression of learning, growing, and becoming. This is the purpose of the oft-misunderstood Mormon practice of baptism for the dead. Jesus taught that all people must be baptized to enter into heaven. For that purpose, we act as proxies to be baptized on behalf of others. (Ancestors, usually.) Those people, in the spirit world, can choose to accept or reject that baptism as they see fit. It's a way to draw the hearts of the children to their fathers, as spoken of in the scriptures.",
      "3) The concept of men becoming as God is appeals to me in a logical sense. God is all powerful. Therefore, what is the greatest thing he can give to someone else? He could'if he wished'make any being equal to himself. It goes by the definition of being all powerful.",
      "I can understand the protestant argument that this is gross arrogance. However, seen in the light of LDS theology'that we existed before this world, that we grow here, then continue to grow and learn on the other side'it starts to make sense.",
      "#### gruevy",
      "All religions containing truth, but not the complete truth, is right out of Mormon doctrine. So is the idea that God and man are the same type of being existing in different states. He just left out the middle part about revealing enough truth to a prophet to restore the complete religion. It's a fantasy series, after all, and I'd say he wrote what he thought would make a great story, but the ideas were probably inspired in some small way by his personal beliefs. To us Mormons it's hard to keep all of our religious influences out of our writing.",
      "#### Renian",
      "That's basically why I asked. When I saw that, I was like, \"There's no way Brandon Sanderson does not subscribe to at least the second part of that theory himself.\"",
      "#### Brandon Sanderson",
      "I strongly subscribe to the second part of the theory. I believe it is a greater idea of Christianity. All Truth is God's, and anything that leads people to be better is part of that Truth'regardless of who is teaching it."

It's almost like they exist in a spectrum, on one end of which is Honor, and on the other - Cultivation; so there are spren that are, for the lack of better example, 90% Honor and 10% Cultivation, and there are spren that are 15% Honor and 85% Cultivation.",

      "Okay. So Brandon writes very fast, something people always point out. Something we wanted to know though from Brandon was, what in his mind is it he looks for in order for a book to be ready for release?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "That's an excellent question that's going to be very difficult to answer. I will say on my speed that I'm not a really fast writer; I'm a persistent writer. I don't take time off. I just write, and I write every day. And that piles up. I think I'm just very fortunate'I have an advantage over a lot of authors in that I don't get writer's block. I don't necessarily write any faster than those authors, but I don't stop; I just keep going. And if you write ten pages a day'which is about what I do, which is not a ton'a lot of authors produce ten pages a day when they're writing, then they hit hang ups, they hit writer's block and things; and that doesn't happen to me, certainly not very often. And so I just write consistently, and I just love to do this, and so... But that's not an indication of quality really, in either way. One of the things I found becoming a writer is some books go fast, some books go slowly. And the reader can't usually tell because a lot of good quality books happen really fast and a lot of good quality books happen very slowly. If you look at Pat Rothfuss' books, _Wise Man's Fear_ took us years to get and is a fantastic book worth every moment of the wait. But some of the great classics like... _A Christmas Carol_ is a famous one'took only a few days to write. And that's happened with various books and classics through history, so we don't really...yeah. Speed is one thing.",
      "What makes a book ready? For me, a lot of whether a book is going to be ready or not comes in, 'Can I fix the problems?' 'Cause every book has problems when I write them. I do write very... I write my drafts beginning to end, pretty quick drafts. And then I need to spend a great deal of time tweaking them, fixing them, going over them again. I write my books much like a sculptor might create a sculpture. And we start...you know, the first pass over doesn't make it look much like a fix; you're just chopping off chunks. And then you refine, and then you refine, and then finally you're sanding. Get these little tiny imperfections out. And that's how I write. My first pass through is...I'm laying down character, dialogue, and plot. I'm not doing description. And in a lot of cases, I'm not doing'for instance, I'm doing a lot of telling rather than showing, because I'm getting on the page what needs to happen. And then I need to go back and take out huge chunks of, you know, people standing up and monologuing. Instead make this actually interesting. If that makes sense. So you get the whole story in the first draft, but it would be boring. And the first draft also often introduces lots of big problems. And when I do my revisions, I need to fix those problems. Primarily, can I get the characters right? Almost every time I write a book, one of the characters, there's something wrong with them. And I need to finish the book before I can figure out what it is that's wrong with them. And the book is ready when I've got them right. At that point, it's a matter of polishing, and the polishing, though it takes time, is easy. No, it's not easy... That's the wrong term. The polishing is expected; it can be done. If I take the right amount of time, I will polish it correctly. But...it's those pieces right before that need to be fixed.",

      "This has probably been asked before, I was wondering since Mistborn, WARbreaker and Elantris share the same Cosmere, is it possible we will see people with certain abilities cross over into other worlds from other series?",
      "[Brandon Sanderson (Goodreads)](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/264132-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson?page=2#comment_14423000)",
      "I think I've said enough about that here. More than that is a RAFO.",
      "For a given book or series I may spend more time on a given aspect. I'd say the other big aspect that takes a lot of time is characterizing the characters the right way. That takes a lot of work, but I tend to do that during my actual writing period, whereas I spend the planning period focusing on worldbuilding and plot. It's when I actually sit down to write a chapter that I explore who a character is, and so it's really hard to pin down timewise which one I spend more time on. And that varies based on the book.",
      "For _Mistborn_, for instance, telekinesis mixed with vector science was interesting to me. In _Warbreaker_ it was the concept of sympathetic magic — the idea that you can create something that's like something else and it will have power over that. I wanted to try and take it in a direction I hadn't seen before and blend that with the concept of animation, bringing inanimate objects to life. Those were intersting concepts because at one point people believed in both of these things as real forms of magic. They believed they could make it work. The myth of the golem goes way back, and the idea of sympathetic magic was around not too long ago — in fact there are still plenty who believe in it, in various forms of superstition.",
      "So I look for a blend of concepts. I usually look for an interesting visual paradigm — something that will work in a way that helps the reader visualize the magic. I don't want it to all happen nebulously in the back of someone's head. (And speaking of rear—end fireballs, I do believe I read a webcomic where someone did that. It was Thog Infinitron...I guess it wasn't a fireball.) But anyway, I'm looking for something that you can see and follow the process of what the character's doing in a way that makes sense.",
      "I find that if there's one thing to take away from this, limitations on magic are more interesting than the powers themselves. And so I'm always looking for interesting limitations, because that forces me to be creative and forces my characters to be creative with what they have.",
      "Is there something in between? That's the advancement I had Vasher discover'what if we build something out of bone, but then encase it in stone to make it strong, and build it in ways that the bone is held together by the force of the Breaths? That's really what you're getting at there, that you need a lot of Breath, a lot of power, to hold all that stone together. There are seams at the joints. What the Breath is doing is clinging there like magical sinew, and it's holding all of that together.",
      "Vasher left the Phantoms Invested with enough Breath to hold them together but not to move. You needed another big, substantial influx of Breath in order to actually make them have motion, to bring them enough strength to move and that sort of thing. So it's kind of a hybrid."

The only piece I can give you right now is try and find a way that you can make a personal connection with them. Try and go to a con that they're at, follow their blog, read books by their authors, have some sort of personal connection so you can know who they are rather than just submitting blind.",

So there's some really awesome stuff.",
      "So, we'll see if this actually ends up working or not. Again, if your father is the owner of Warner Brothers, go and put in a good word for me. We're kind of long shots because all we are is an author and several producers who have no major credits to their name. And I sold it to them specifically because- you know, I sold Alcatraz to Dreamworks for a lot of money and then I just had to like say goodbye to the project and I like what they did with it but it was basically they took the project. And I, for Mistborn, wanted to have more control which also means my chances of actually getting it made go down quite dramatically. Ask Orson Scott Card how long it took to get made Ender's Game made and you will see the same sort of thing, but then he's getting it made his way, eventually.

And the seal is very much like a little program, and she stamps it on something and uses that stamp to rewrite the history of the object. As long as the seal is there, the object thinks it has this other history. The example you see in the book is you know- an old dirty table that's not been cared for, she can write a seal for its history, she has to figure out what its history was first. And she can write out a seal that basically reprograms that past, so when she stamps it, it thinks it's been cared for all along and suddenly it gains this lacquer, it's beautiful, it's been well-cared for, because in that fake Forgery of the history, that's what happened to it. And that's what her magic does, which is why she's been hired to Forge a copy of the emperor's soul.",

      "Warbreaker 6.0 is done! I worked on it a good ten hours today, and managed to push through to the ending. I'm too tired right now to post it, but I'll get it up early next week. The revision took a little longer than I would have wanted'almost three weeks'but it feels very good to have it done and off the plate.",
      "That leaves only a couple of impending time-stealers from _A Memory of Light_. I'll need to do draft work on Alcatraz Three sometime in September, though that should be VERY quick. (It's one fifth the size of _Warbreaker_, and there is a lot less to do on it.) I'll also need to do the copyedit for _Warbreaker_; that should come sometime in November, and should take me about a week. Other than that, there are two convention visits (Worldcon and Dragon*con) and the book tour in October that will be bumps in the road. However, I'm confident that I can get a good chunk more written before Worldcon even arrives.",
      "Next on the plate is to do a couple solid drafts on the 25% of _A Memory of Light_ which I've finished. I need to get it into a state that Harriet can look at and send it too her as soon as possible, as this chunk threatens to be the one that could need the most revisions. How well she thinks I did on these pages will be a very good barometer of how much draft work I'll have to do on the entire book once it's complete.",
      "However, I do intend to divide my time between that revision and'occasionally'dipping into writing some new words. So the percentage bar should start moving again next week, if slowly at first while I spend a lot of time drafting."

      "Do you have any advice for writers looking to get published?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Yeah, yeah, a couple things. First one is, read a lot. Read a lot in the genre you want to be published in. If you want to write short stories, read short stories. If you want to write novels, read novels. Read in the genre, but also read widely. But nothing is more frustrating than someone who says \"I want to publish fantasy novels\" who's never read any. Find out what other people are doing that's exciting and try and add something to it.",
      "The other thing is, just write. Know that you don't have to be perfect when you start. Nobody sits down and expects to be able to play the piano the first time. But a lot of writers, it seems, get frustrated when they try to write their first book that it's not capturing the vision in their head. So, don't be afraid to be bad at it long enough to get good at it. Just sit down and start writing. Turn off your internal editor. Understand that your first book's not going to be very good and that's just fine. Practice writing it 'cause that's how you learn to write. Do it consistently. Set a time every day or every week where you write. Consistently keep that goal. Work on your books. Don't let yourself write a first chapter, throw it away and write another one, and then throw it away and write another one. Force yourself to finish.",

I had the right tone, so I kept writing, expanding my outline, letting the story grow as big as it wanted to be.",

But I do plan things out a lot, specifically my magic systems. This is a big focus to me, partially because it's become one of my big calling cards in the genre.

      "Talk about your process of writing; and also about how you creatively approach it.",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Every writer has a different process. There's as many ways to do this as there are writers in the world. For me, my creative process is that I'm always searching for the ideas that I can connect into a larger story. I feel that a book is more than just one idea. A good book is a collection of ideas; usually a good idea for each character'something that forms the core of their conflict'several good ideas for the setting: something that's going to drive the economy, something that's going to drive (for me the magic) the setting'that sort of thing'and then several good plot ideas. These all bounce around in my head'I'll grab them randomly.",
      "An example of one of these was for Mistborn: For Mistborn, one of the original seeds was, I was watching the Harry Potter movies that had come out, and I was thinking about Lord of the Rings, which I had just reread, and I was thinking, you know, I like the hero's journey: young, plucky protagonist goes, collects a band of unlikely followers, face the Dark Lord' and I thought 'yeah, but those Dark Lords always get, just like, a terrible, raw end of the deal. They're always beat by some dufusy kid or thing like that,' and I thought 'I want to write a book where the Dark Lord wins.'",
      "But that was kind of a downer of a book, as I considered it, a little bit, you know, 'you read this book, and then at the end the hero loses,' that's kind of a downer. So I stuck that in the back of my mind saying 'I want to do something with that idea, but it's going to take me a little while to figure out exactly what I want to do with that idea.' And then I was watching one of my favorite movies from a long time ago'both of these ideas come from movies, many of them don't but these two did'Sneakers, if any of you have seen it, just a, like an amazingly awesome heist story, and I thought 'ya' know, I haven't seen a heist story done in fantasy in forever,' little did I know that Scott Lynch was going to release one, like, one year later [The Lies of Locke Lamora].",
      "_But_ nobody had done one, and so I said 'I want to do a fantasy heist story.' The two ideas combined together in my head. Alright: world where the Dark Lord won, a hero failed; thousands of years later, a gang of thieves decided to rip the Dark Lord off and kind of try to over thrown him their way, you know, making themselves-- by making themselves rich.",
      "And those ideas combined together. And so a story grows in my mind like little atoms bouncing together and forming a molecule: they'll stick to each other and make something different. Those two ideas combine to make a better idea, in my opinion, together. And then character ideas I'd been working on stuck to that, and then magic systems I'd actually been working on separately. Allomancy and Feruchemy, two of the magic systems in Mistborn, were actually designed for different worlds, and then I combined them together and they worked really well together, with the metals being a common theme.",
      "I did all of that, and when it comes down to write a book I sit down and I put this all on a page, and then I start filling in holes by brainstorming. 'What would go well here, what would go well here, I need more here' [accompanying gestures indicate different 'here's']. And I fill out my outline that way, and I fill out my 'World Guide,' as I call it.

So I headed over to the Harvard Bookstore, where he would be signing and answering questions. Now, this bit was a little strange for me. I've met Brandon before (probably a dozen times or so between '06 and '09), all at varying levels of fame, I listen to writing excuses every week, and I follow his blag, so it wasn't \"oh my gosh, I get to meet him\" jitters. I feel like, in all the ways that I want to, I already know Brandon.",

I've never a big \"sign things\" person, especially when the signer is a person to me, and not a Figure (if that makes any sense). And (2) this was the first time that I had one-on-one interaction with Brandon while considering myself an agent for a higher group (namely, the 17th Shard). It was a bit nerve-wracking in a way that was completely new to me. Anyway, ending my indulgent self-psychoanalysis...",

I was one of those authors who like to write a book, be done with it and move on. Then I would say, 'Oh, I'll write the next one really well.' I liked writing. I really enjoyed that process, but there were some tough years in there, particularly after I started feeling that I was writing things that were really good, that were publishable, that were quite solid and I still kept getting rejections. People kept telling me the books I was writing were too long, I kept sending in these big massive epic fantasies.",

So I decided to try writing what I felt the market was doing, and started chasing the market a little bit. I failed at that: I wrote a couple of books that were just awful. That's the point when I really had my moment of 'why am I doing this? What am I doing here?' This was in 2001, maybe early 2002.",
      "I kind of had to make the decision that I was doing this for me. I was writing books because I loved books; I was doing it because I loved writing. I was going to write the type of book that I wanted to write. I had to decide I didn't care if I didn't get published. I decided I would keep writing books until I died, even if I ended up with seventy-five novels unpublished. I actually made that decision.",
      "The next book I wrote was _The Way of Kings_, throwing away all the stuff that people said to me. They tell me my books are too long, and I wrote a book that was twice as long as any book I had written before. They were telling me my books were too expensive, so I wrote one with thirty interior illustrations.",
      "While I was working on _Way of Kings_ I actually sold my sixth book, which was _Elantris_, one of the ones I had written in the era when I really felt I was doing good work, before I decided to try chasing the market. At that point it was like: 'Oh, I just sold one of those!' It actually worked out for me, but it was about eighteen months after I made that decision, that I eventually sold a book in 2003\\. Since then I've had the conviction that I do this because I love it. I haven't had to have the affirmation to push me along, but it's great that people do enjoy my books. I certainly wouldn't be making a living at it if people didn't enjoy it, but I'd still be writing."

      "HOW MANY PEOPLE NOMINATE AND VOTE?  ",
      "This depends on the category, since eligible nominators are encouraged to nominate only in categories they feel they have enough experience with. Last year when Worldcon was in Melbourne, Australia, there were [700 nominations for Best Novel](http://www.aussiecon4.org/hugoawards/files/2010HugoVotingReport.pdf). So if each person nominated five novels, that could have been as few as 140 nominating ballots. (Except that _The Windup Girl_ by Paolo Bacigalupi received 142 nominations, so clearly many people nominated fewer than five titles.) _Julian Comstock_ tied with _Palimpsest_ for fifth place with 62 nominations, so both made it to the final ballot.",
      "In the Best Related Work category last year, there were 259 nominations. The top nominee received 56 nominations, and there was again a tie for fifth place, with 29 nominations. (Writing Excuses received eight nominations last year.)",
      "The final vote totals exhibit similar differences. 875 ballots were counted for Best Novel, and there was a tie for first with 380 votes for both China Mi'ville's _The City & The City_ and _The Windup Girl_. 548 ballots were counted for Best Related Work, and _This is Me, Jack Vance!_ won with 251 votes.",
      "Here's a sample voting breakdown for the final ballot, from last year:",
      "Best Dramatic Presentation Short Form",
      "> _Doctor Who_: \"The Waters of Mars\" (winner) 172 172 204 212 350  ",
      "> _Dollhouse_: \"Epitaph 1\" 199 201 205 243 278  ",
      "> _Doctor Who_: \"The Next Doctor\" 144 144 173 203  ",
      "> _FlashForward_: \"No More Good Days\" 123 125 127  ",
      "> _Doctor Who_: \"Planet of the Dead\" 70 70  ",
      "> No Award 59",
      "The first column of numbers indicates what people ranked as their #1 choice. 199 people picked \"Epitaph 1\" as their favorite, and only 172 people picked \"The Waters of Mars\" as their favorite. Yet 199 was not above the 50% threshold necessary to win. So the instant runoff began: the lowest vote-getters were eliminated and those voters' preferences reassigned. Of people who voted \"Planet of the Dead\" #1, when that was eliminated, their #2 moved up to #1 and the votes were counted again; four had voted \"Epitaph 1\" as #2 and 32 had voted \"The Waters of Mars\" #2\\. \"Epitaph 1\" was ahead by a vote, but still didn't have enough to win. This process continued until eventually all but the top two were eliminated, and \"The Waters of Mars\" was declared the winner, even though it was behind in every round but the last.",
      "You'll also notice the \"No Award\" listing. If you're voting and think none of the entries on the final ballot deserve your vote, you can pick No Award. I know that No Award won in the Dramatic Presentation category in 1977, but this is rare. There are more details on the Hugo voting system here."

      "You also run the Writing Excuses podcast with Howard Tayler and Dan Wells; did the idea start with you, or was it the brainchild of a get-together? And why do you think it has become so popular?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "A couple years ago, I realized that there's a whole lot of writing talent hanging around my area. I also realized that my brother is getting a degree that focuses heavily on web marketing, and that he had just taken a podcasting class. These two ideas started battling to the death in the arena of my mind, until they merged into the weekly podcast known as Writing Excuses. Dan Wells and I have been friends since college, and before we were published we went to conventions together to hit up editors. (His first published book, horror novel _I Am Not a Serial Killer_, recently came out in the UK.) Howard I met more recently, but I'd long been a fan of his Schlock Mercenary webcomic (schlockmercenary.com). I felt that our combination of writing styles and backgrounds would make an interesting mix for the podcast, and Dan and Howard were enthusiastic. As for why the podcast has become popular, I think our slogan has a lot to do with it''Fifteen minutes long, because you're in a hurry, and we're not that smart.' Our goal is to be quick, informative, and conversational'and, if possible, occasionally amusing. That has clearly struck a chord with our listeners.",
      "My mother, however, thought I should study something more concrete and said I could keep writing on the side. I started college as a biochemistry major, but when I took two years off to serve a mission for my church I realized I didn't miss chemistry at all and just wanted to write. On my off days I worked on what eventually became my first novel, and when I got back to school I changed my major to English and determined to become a professional author."

Well, it's happening again [this January in Salt Lake City](http://www.superstarswritingseminars.com/), with additional special guest instructor Sherrilyn Kenyon. I mention it now because the tuition rates go up at the end of October. This conference focuses on the business of writing, and I had a blast at last year's event in Pasadena. Here's how I described it last year:",
      "So many people ask me for writing advice and help with their work that I decided to say yes to this invitation because it will give people the chance they've been asking for. I realize the seminar is expensive'which means it's not for everyone'but as busy as I'm getting nowadays, something like this seems the only way.",
      "The other writers participating could all still teach even me a thing or two. In fact, Dave specifically did teach me a lot about the writing business'it was while taking a writing class from him close to ten years ago that I finally began to understand what it takes to make it in publishing. And Kevin gave me invaluable advice that has made my life as a writer much easier over the past year. If you read the testimonials in the sidebar on the site you'll see names of pro writers whose work I've mentioned before or who we've had as guests on Writing Excuses, including Eric James Stone, Brandon Mull, John Brown, and Bob Defendi'all of them have benefited extremely from classes taught by Dave and/or Kevin & Rebecca. The instructor talent lineup for this seminar is daunting even to me, and I'm one of them!",
      "This year's conference will cover topics such as:",
      "* Economics of Commercial Publishing",
      "* How Editors Look at Manuscripts, Novels, and Short Fiction",
      "* Dissecting a Book Contract",
      "* How to Read and Understand a Royalty Statement",
      "* Dirty Secrets: What You Need to Know About Being a Professional Author",
      "* How to Leverage Your Intellectual Property",

A little less like Dragon Age in that it's a solo adventure with one person—certainly there are NPCs and things, but we're not talking about a party; we're talking about a Mistborn doing awesome stuff. That's what I wanted this game to be. There are so many different ways you could take a game like this; I would like to try different aspects.",
      "One of my favorite games recently was Demon Souls, and its sequel Dark Souls. I like gameplay mechanics like that, for a game like this.

Certainly with a stronger RPG element to it.",

What feels more like Mistborn to you? But at the end of the day, I have to let them do their job, which is program a great game, and come up with an engaging and fun system.",
      "I can have some input in it myself, such as the dialogue and story—I can step in and say hey, I know how to do this; let me do it. So I have done that for this game—I've stepped in and I'm writing the dialogue and the story myself, and I'm going to try to make it the best it can be to match Mistborn.

It can be assumed that Lanfear did the same thing; Moghedien has shown no sign of having the ability (or perhaps the desire) to reach others' dreams, but she can trap Dreamwalkers in their own dreams in _Tel'aran'rhiod_. Aran'gar can do it weakly, and then only if she is sleeping right next to the person. Brandon has a point about the fact that all three of them dreamed the same dream apparently at once, but in once instance, after Perrin found the wolves, it seemed to Rand and Mat that they fell asleep, had the dream, and immediately woke up, when Moiraine says they were asleep for four hours.",

      "Who do you contact to PUBLISH a book?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I don't know if I can really cover that one in this particular response. It's a big topic. The short answer, however, is to follow these steps. 1) Write the book. 2) Research publishers based on those who publish books in that genre. Look for publishers who publish books with similar themes and tropes as your own. Then, research those publishers, find out their submission guidelines, and submit to them. Also, you may want to consider researching agents and submitting to them. Be careful; there are a lot of disreputable agents out there. Be looking for agents (and publishers) who do not charge a reading fee, and who represent authors you've heard of. A quick rule of thumb is that if an agent (or their umbrella agency) has not sold a book by a newer author to a major publisher in the last year or two, they probably aren't worth your time. If you want to learn more, head over to my podcast at WritingExcuses.com and listen to the [several](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2008/08/24/<span class='highlight'>writing</span>-<span class='highlight'>excuses</span>-episode-29-talking-publishing-with-lou-anders/) [podcasts](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2008/09/02/<span class='highlight'>writing</span>-<span class='highlight'>excuses</span>-episode-30-talking-revision-with-moshe-feder/) we've [done](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2008/04/27/<span class='highlight'>writing</span>-<span class='highlight'>excuses</span>-episode-12-submitting-to-editors-part-1/) with [editors](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2008/05/04/<span class='highlight'>writing</span>-<span class='highlight'>excuses</span>-episode-13-submitting-to-editors-part-2/).",
      "Writers have to be self-motivated, and you can't be in it for the money. If you want to make piles of cash, go into programming or web design. Writers should write because they absolutely love it, and are willing to work long hours for potentially no pay just for the experience of writing. That isn't to say you can't make money at this; but in most cases, the money will be slow coming, and you will spend years writing before you are able to make a living at it.",
      "Every person's experience is different, but I wrote 13 novels across nearly ten years before I sold one. The best thing you can do starting off, in my opinion, is give yourself two or three years to just WRITE and practice. Read good books on writing (Stephen King's is quite good) and read widely, looking for examples of good fiction that you admire within your genre, but also looking outside the genre to see what other writers are doing well. Try to incorporate that into your own writing, learning the craft and adapting what you learn to your own style. But mostly just write. A lot."

Upon arrival I passed out our shirts and sat down. We ordered drinks and began by introducing ourselves and what we knew of each other. Skipping the details of our planning we began to discuss the books themselves. Only two of us, myself included, had finished _Towers of Midnight_ so we had to be careful with our discussion lest we ruin it all. Where nerds gather the conversation is bound to get animated and we discussed many things over good drinks and some homemade brownies that one of our Tower Guards provided. Yum, mint.",

Since the question of our duties during the signing were still up in the air we were herded into the upstairs break-room. We made ourselves at home and discussed our impending meet with Brandon and Harriet. Unfortunately, Brandon's flight due to the time difference going from the West to East coast was due in at 6pm as opposed to the 2:45PM the bookstore staff expected. Brandon and Harriet themselves arrived straight from the airport at 6:30ish and proceeded once freshening up to being signing pre-release copies for those attendees who wanted a signed copy but could not stay."

Even when I was not as popular as I am now, I didn't have to revise right away because there was so much time between when I turned in a book and when it came out. Nowadays, when editorial comments come in, I've basically got to drop everything and do revisions. I've never liked revising very much.

I'm about forty percent of the way through the first draft; the problem is never first draft, though; revisions take a long time on a book this big.

It would occur in the capitol city of Fjorden, and would star Kiin's children as viewpoint characters along with a Seon viewpoint character. The plot of the book: Wyrn has declared that Jaddeth, the Derethi God, is going to finally return. (A new interpretation of the scriptures says that he'll return when everyone east of the mountains converts, so they don't have to worry about Teod and Arelon.) Kiin's family, ambassadors to the Fjordell state, has to deal with the chaos of this announcement, and investigate the truth behind the Dakhor magic. Thoughts?"

Meaning, practice writing stories where you just go off on whatever strikes you, and practice writing a story where you spend a lot of time on an outline. Try to figure out which method works best for you when trying a specific type of story, and perhaps try some hybrids. Anything that helps you write better stories more regularly is a tool to keep practicing.",
      "Try a dialogue scene, where you try to evoke character and setting using ONLY dialogue. No descriptions allowed. (This is best when you're focused on making the characters each distinct simply through how they talk.)",

      "_White Sand_: Taldain",
      "_Dragonsteel_: Yolen",
      "There are others, but I haven't talked much about those yet, so I'll leave them off for now.",
      "I do have intentions of rewriting these books and publishing them eventually. They each have pieces of the story. (Though I may decide to shift certain themes from one series to another as I eventually write and publish them.) I've been known to email _White Sand_ or _Aether of Night_ to readers who email and ask. (Though it does make me cringe a little to do so. In many of these books, I was experimenting with magic, theme, and narrative style'some experiments were a success, some were failures.)",
      "_Dragonsteel_ is frozen; I don't send it out any longer, as to not spoil the parts of _The Way of Kings_ that I decided fit better in that world. So the only way to get it now is to borrow it from BYU. I've been told that _Dragonsteel_ is the only undergraduate BYU honor's thesis ever to have been be read so often that it needed to be rebound. (A dubious honor, I'm not sure how I feel about so many people reading a book of mine that is that mediocre.)",
      "Let me say this. Hoid got wrapped up in things he didn't expect to be involved in, and they dominated much of his time during the events of _Mistborn: Well of Ascension_. He spent most of the book in a different place from most of the viewpoint characters. He's only near them for a very short time, and he's deeply in disguise. I couldn't include his name, as he'd never have used the name \"Hoid\" for himself there, because it wouldn't have been right for the disguise. He'd have used another pseudonym. (He didn't, by the way, mention one.)",
      "I've probably said too much already. Now, perhaps what people should asking me is this: \"What has Hoid been up to in all of these books?\" Or, maybe they shouldn't ask me, as I wouldn't be likely to answer. (There are clues in the novels, however.) No, he's not just hanging out. Yes, I know what he's been doing. Will I write his scenes some day? Maybe. We'll see. There may be short stories posted on my website.",
      "I'd consider 30k a year to do what I love an extremely good trade-off. Yes, your friends in computers will be making far more. But you get to be a writer.",
      "The only caveat here is that I did indeed get very lucky with my placement at Tor. It's the successful hardcover release that makes the above scenario work. If you only had the paperback, and everyone who bought the hardcover bought that instead, you'd have to be selling around 60k copies to make it work. That's very possible, and I know a lot of midlist writers who do it.",
      "Anyway, numbers shouldn't be what gets you into this business. If you have to tell stories, tell them. To be a writer, I feel you need to have such a love of the process that you'd write those books even if you never sold one. It's not about the money, and really shouldn't be. (And sorry to go on so long. I just feel it important to give aspiring writers the same kinds of help that I got.)",
      "To be honest, that's probably not a great list. Those are the movies I watch over and over, but there are a lot of movies I love, but have only seen a few times. I'm not generally a 'watch it over again' type of guy, so it's hard to pick favorites. I come back to the genre films or things like Jackie Chan because they're quirky and rewatchable, but that doesn't actually mean they're my favorite'or that they've influenced me as much as other films. For instance, _Lawrence of Arabia_ blew my mind, and _The Sting_ influenced how I write quite a bit. But I've only ever seen those films once. But I do keep coming back to _Gattica_ as one of the movies I think does what storytelling should do, when done perfectly right.",

      "The signing. The proprietors of Mysterious Galaxy, (a small, very pleasant independent bookseller which specializes in Hard Sci-Fi and SFF) had everyone exit the store to prepare for the signing, as it required setting up two lines. Those who had already purchased a book, and been given a signing line number (Insectoid & Mom were #1 and #2, yours truly was #3) in one line, those who needed to purchase a book for signing in another. As most of you have read regarding other signing events, Brandon gives each person his complete attention for several minutes, having a sincere conversation, while personalizing his signatures. He accepted questions during this time, but limited to one or two per person. When I told him I had a list of questions from the TOR.COM Leigh Butler re-read crowd, he said he'd gladly work with me after the main signing line.",
      "I would estimate 120-130 folks got between 1 and 5 books signed each. Several brought _Warbreaker_ (myself included), Mistborn or Alcatraz books, and he signed anything of his that was brought, while limiting personalizations.",
      "After the main signing line, he began signing store stock books, as well as doing additional personalizations for the Storm Leaders, who did a terrific job and enjoyed the time as much as any of us. Once he began this, he looked back at me and said, \"Two more questions now, go ahead\". Then periodically as he was working he'd take more.",
      "During this activity, he was handed the store phone several times. It seems he found a moment in all of this to send a tweet, and folks following him on Twitter started calling in because he told them he'd be at the store about another 45 minutes. The first call came from Australia. He spoke like a long-time friend to each of the folks on the phone, and prepared personalizations for them to be delivered.",
      "Once everything else settled down, and a few Storm Leaders who hadn't read _The Gathering Storm_ yet had gone, he took a bunch more of my questions. When the shop workers started looking at the clock, he said, \"Let's let these folks close up, I'll step outside with you for a few more minutes to ask the rest of your questions\". We shook hands and he got into the car to take him back to his hotel about 75 minutes after the signing was supposed to end."

      "Question",
      "Have you ever thought about making your writing class open?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Yes I have. There are some back and forths here. One thing, about the classes, I really do like teaching at BYU. I like being a BYU teacher, I like being involved a little bit in our Alma Mater, I like coming here, and if I were to make the class open, basically, what I would have to do, I would have to stop teaching at BYU and go to a library or something like that, and just do it in an Auditorium, and I like the class as it is. BYU has policies that say 'You have to be a BYU student to go to the class' and that's not something I can influence or change. So as long as I have it at BYU, it kind of has to be that way. Does that make sense?",
      "Though I've tried to let them get me to record it and like Webcast it, but they have requirements and rules that so far we haven't been able to make that work. But Writing Excuses is basically the way that I do my class without doing my class, if that makes sense.",
      "Footnote",
      "Brandon has decided to call book 2 \"Words of Radiance\"",
      "<a href=\"\"></a>",
      "And so that's how I pitched Mistborn to my editor.",
      "_Alloy of Law_ is actually a deviation from that, because I didn't want people to forget about Mistborn, I wanted them to keep reading Mistborn, so I wanted them to keep releasing things, and we'll eventually get to that second trilogy'",
      "Hey there you are Mark! I heard you got number one.",
      "#### MARK",
      "Yep.",
      "#### BRANDON SANDERSON",
      "You're crazy (laughter). You're awesome though. He even beat the <a>17thshard</a> people, which is really a hard thing to do. (oohs and aahs) Two hours. Beat them by two hours.",
      "So _Alloy of Law_ I wanted to set up things for the second trilogy. I didn't want to do the second trilogy yet, because the second trilogy, like the first trilogy is kind of bigger books, with a very involved storyline evolved across three books, and I didn't want to be releasing that parallel to Stormlight Archive, which is the same sort of thing. Very evolved books where you tie a lot of things together, and so I wanted a series of Mistborn novels that were more independent.",
      "_Alloy of Law_ is intended to be a 'read it, have fun.' Eventually I may end up doing more with those characters, but when I do, you won't have to remember that much about this one. It's not like you have to remember a cast of 500 characters. You can just keep track of the main characters. They're more of an episodic adventure. I kind of imagine _Alloy of Law_ being'I'm not totally sure how to describe it. It's like you have the giant movie that comes out, and then you have a TV show that's based off of it, and then another big movie series, or something like that, if that makes any sense.",
      "So that's what _Alloy of Law_ is. So Hoid is very involved in the third Mistborn trilogy, he's also very involved in _Dragonsteel_, which is actually the first book in the sequence, long before _Elantris_ happened. So eventually I will tell that story. You can read a draft of it at the BYU library. It's the only copy that I know of in existence. It's almost always checked out. It's my Honors thesis, and it's not very good. It really is not very good, but basically it's involving the ideas that eventually will become _Dragonsteel_ once I write it again. But I stole the Shattered Plains and put them in Roshar instead because the fit better there."

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I had a bit of a challenge in this book because'and you may want to put a spoiler warning on this interview'at the end of the first Mistborn trilogy, one of the characters became the god of this world. He became a god figure, an almost omnipotent figure. I had planned this from the beginning, but it also offers a challenge, because in this world you have a real deity that is interacting, that is a character'not to say that in our world God doesn't interact with us, because as you know I am a faithful, religious person. However, I think there is a different interaction going here where the reader has spent time with this person as a character, and now he is a deity figure. So how to deal with this is one of the big challenges in worldbuilding this next several hundred years.",
      "I wanted Sazed to be involved'I didn't want to just have him vanish and not be part of things. I wanted to acknowledge what happened with him and make it part of the mythology of the story. But at the same time, having one of your characters turn into God runs you right into the trouble of literal _deus ex machina_, once one of your characters has all of this power. So walking that line was both exciting and also very challenging.",
      "I like to deal with religion in my books. I like to look at all aspects of it, and in this book I wanted to look at what it would be like if someone like Sazed had been put in this position and people started worshiping him'what do you do with that?",
      "To worldbuild the urban fantasy trilogy coming up, I need to know everything that happened in the intervening centuries. Some stories popped up in there that I knew would happen, that would be referenced in the second trilogy. So I thought, why don't I tell some of these stories, to cement them in my mind and to keep the series going.",
      "I started writing _The Alloy of Law_ not really knowing how long it would be'knowing the history and everything that happened, but not knowing how much of it I wanted to do in prose form. Things just clicked as they sometimes do, and I ended up turning it into a novel.",
      "You will have to look. Hoid is in the book, though his name doesn't appear. But the things happening here during this interim are not of deep interest to Hoid like the things happening in the original trilogy, so he is playing a much smaller role here than he was in the original trilogy.",

      "I realize that not everyone can make it to one of my signings. It's unfair if you live in Germany but want a numbered copy. Therefore, I've started doing virtual booksignings with Weller Book Works (formerly known as Sam Weller's)—a wonderful independent bookseller in Salt Lake City that has been a supporter of my books since I was a nobody—alongside the standard signings I do there. Update: SOLD OUT, sorry! If you emailed and haven't heard back yet, you should still get a book. Don't worry.",
      "I will be going in to Weller's sometime right before Christmas to sign, number, and personalize 700 copies of _A Memory of Light_. Weller's will then ship them out; they will try to time the shipping so the book arrives at your door on January 8th. However, they're not allowed to deliver before that date, so they can't cut things too close, and some books may arrive after the 8th. If that's the case, though, they'll try to keep the delay as short as possible. International orders will be shipped first, since those have the longest transit time. Due to the size of this book, Weller's will be shipping each book in a Priority Mail medium flat-rate box, which unfortunately drives the price up. But the book itself has a discount of 20% for preorders by December 7th, which helps offset that. Shipping will be $12.00 in-country, $34 to Mexico and Canada, and $49 to other international. If your order is shipped inside Utah, there will also be sales tax. (Note that Weller's cannot track packages internationally. They've tried.) I'm really very sorry that the shipping cost is so high, but books this big just won't fit into cheaper envelopes. On the plus side, the box can fit TWO books, so if you buy two to ship to the same address there is no increased shipping charge.",
      "When you call Weller's, please be certain to tell them (even if they don't ask) specifically how you want the book personalized. If you don't tell them specifically, they will have it signed but not personalized. Simply telling them your name is not enough. You have to tell them \"I want it personalized to John\" (for example). If you don't want it personalized, tell them \"Signature Only\" just in case.",
      "About the numbering: If you get a book from one of the two release events (Weller's or the BYU-or-Charleston midnight release), I'll number your copy. These numbers are less about being limited editions and more about getting a special add-on, an indication that you made it to one of the initial events. The numbers will trade off in blocks of 100, so books through Weller's will receive numbers 101—200, 301—400, 501—600, etc. Note that if the midnight release ends up in Charleston, I will definitely still sign books in Utah sometime during the tour, without numbering.",

      "How did you become interested in being a writer?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "My start as a writer can be traced back to when I was fourteen years old. I was not a very distinguished student, so to speak: Bs and Cs in all my classes. I really didn't have any direction, either; there was nothing I really loved to do. I was also what they call a \"reluctant reader\". My reading skills were not fantastic, so when I tried reading Lord of the Rings for the first time, it was just completely over my head, and I assumed that all fantasy novels were boring. It was a teacher who handed me the very first fantasy novel I ever really finished reading. The book was called _Dragonsbane_ by Barbara Hambly, and it had this gorgeous Michael Whelan cover on it which immediately caught my eye. I read the book and absolutely fell in love with it. I became an avid reader, mostly of fantasy novels, over the next couple of years. Soon I began to think, \"You know, somebody out there is making a living at this, and it seems like it's something that I would really enjoy doing.\" That's when I found some purpose and direction.",
      "There were certain influences in my life, my mother primarily, who convinced me that being a writer was hard to do, and she was right. It's one of these jobs where not everybody who tries it actually makes it. She convinced me to go into chemistry during college because I had done well in the sciences all throughout high school, thinking I could write in my spare time and have a real, solid job. It wasn't terrible advice; I'm just not sure it was the right advice for me at that time. I served a mission and during that time I was very, very pleased to be on another continent, away from chemistry. I really missed writing, though, because I'd been doing it for fun all through that freshman year before I left. I actually started my first novel when I was fifteen, but it didn't go anywhere. It was rather derivative and all those things that you expect from the majority of novels written by guys in high school. Knowing I could actually produce something, though, gave me some encouragement. Of course I didn't show it to anybody. I hid it behind the painting in my room because I didn't want anyone to see the pages I'd printed out and make fun of me.",
      "When I got back from my mission, I thought, \"You know what? I'm going to give it a try.\" It sounds kind of stupid, but like I said, there are people that get to do this for a living, and I decided that I was never going to be happy unless I gave it a shot. So I changed my major to English because I assumed that's what you did if you wanted to be a writer. I've since learned that that's not the only way to go about it, but it did work for me. It gave me a much better grounding in the classics. I was able to take some creative writing classes too, as a part of my required credits. I got a job working the graveyard shift at a hotel, which was great for my writing because I was there most weeknights from 11 pm until 7 am, and the only requirements that they put me to were, \"Just don't fall asleep. Do whatever you want, just don't fall asleep. We need you awake in case there's an emergency or if anyone comes in.\" I ended up spending a lot of my time working on novels during those early morning hours, and that's how I was able to pay for school, attend it full-time, and still have time for writing. I did that for about five years until I eventually decided that I would go back for a master's degree. It was sort of a way to delay having to make the inevitable decision of what I was really going to do with my life. My backup career then became working as an English professor, partially because I do enjoy teaching, and I enjoy scholarship on the academic level. My parents were worried about me, though. They were afraid that I was going to end up begging for beans on the side of the road, or whatever it is that starving artists do. At least being able to tell them that I was getting a master's degree was helpful. It was also nice to be part of a community of writers and to be able to see what other people were creating.",
      "One more of the ideas for the Mistborn series happened when I was driving home to see my mom. She lives in Idaho Falls, and after passing Tremonton on the I-15, I just went through this fog bank driving at seventy miles an hour. Even though my car was actually driving into the fog, it looked like the mist was moving around me instead of me moving through it. It was just this great image that I wrote down in my notebook years before I ended up writing _Mistborn_.",
      "After a while, all these different ideas, like atoms, were bouncing around in my head and eventually started to run together to form molecules (the molecules being the story). Keep in mind, a good book is more than just one good idea. A good book is twelve or thirteen or fourteen great ideas that all play off of each other in ways that create even better ideas. There were my two original ideas—a gang of thieves in a fantasy world, and a story where the dark lord won—that ended up coming together and becoming the same story. Suddenly I had a world where the prophecies were wrong, the hero had failed, and a thousand years later a gang of thieves says, \"Well, let's try this our way. Let's rob the dark lord silly and drive his armies away from him. Let's try to overthrow the empire.\" These are all the seeds of things that make bigger ideas.",
      "After I outlined the book, it turned out to be quite bit longer than I expected, and I then began working through those parts that weren't fully developed yet, changing some things. I ended up downplaying the heist story in the final version of the book, despite the fact that it was a heist novel in one of my original concepts. But as I was writing it, I felt that if I was going to make it into a trilogy, I needed the story to have more of an epic scope. The heist was still there, and still the important part of the book, but it kind of became the setting for other, bigger things in the story, such as the epic coming-of-age of one of the characters, the interactions between the characters, and dealing with the rise and fall of the empire. But that happens in the process of writing. Sometimes the things that inspire you to begin a story in the first place eventually end up being the ones that are holding it back. Allomancy, the magic system in the book, was a separate idea that came about through these revisions.",
      "I wrote the books in the trilogy straight through. I had the third one rough drafted by the time the first one had to be in its final form so that I could keep everything consistent and working together the way I wanted it to. I didn't want it to feel like I was just making it up as I went along, which I feel is one of the strengths of the series. I don't know if I'll ever be able to have that opportunity again in a series, but it certainly worked well for the Mistborn books."

      "What do you get out of doing your Writing Excuses podcasts?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "So what do I get out of it? I get to be part of the community. I went to my very first convention when I was seventeen. It was held in Lincoln, Nebraska, where I was growing up. I'd never been to a sci-fi con before, and Katherine Kurtz was the guest. And I wanted so badly to be a writer, but I knew nothing about any of this. I chatted with her for a good 45 minutes about being a writer. She sat down with me and chatted with me, and it blew my mind. She's a best seller, she was top of her game. And it was so inspiring to me. And later on, Lee Modesitt did the same thing. Robin Hobb did the same thing. When I started coming to the conventions, I would say, \"I want to be a writer. I have no idea what to do.\" And they'd say, \"Sit down, kid.\" And they would start telling me stuff, and I try to regurgitate it on Writing Excuses. The thing to remember, guys, if you listen to the podcast, remember that everything we talk about is a tool you can try. It is not the method, because there is no method. Keep that in mind. But I'm trying to just be part of this. Writing is so solitary that when you can have a community and be part of one and chat with people, it's wonderful.",
      "And he wrote this wonderful story about these paragons in the world. It was our world plus, where people get chosen as paragons as like a religion . . . it was so cool. There's like an ancient Greek paragon next to a Christian paragon that's based on kind of . . . anyway, it's great. You ought to have him post on it. It was the best thing I had had come through the class in a long while. It's a mixture of a lot of things. Mostly, I talk about the grand scale of being a fantasy writer is being able to, in the first few pages, get across a sense of character and world without dumping paragraphs of thick text on us. And that is the best—if someone can learn to do that, if you can pick it up and read it, and read a few pages and feel like you're in the world and character, but you haven't been dumped on—that's what Brian was doing. Also, the premise was awesome, the premise was great. But you know, it's that character voice. And it's weird because in fantasy, right, it's our magic systems and our worldbuilding that distinguishes us. But a great magic system and terrible writing is a bad book. And a weak magic system with great writing is a great book. And so even though this is what it's about, the skill that a writer really needs to learn is not the magic systems or not the worldbuilding—that's great. The skill is telling a powerful character in a different world from ourselves without making you feel like you're reading a history textbook. And Brian did that.",
      "So, there you go . . . so you guys should read the book. I just finished it—I read it late. This is what a bad teacher I am, right? He gets published, I read the book a year later. It came out in April and I finished it in June, but he gave it to me . . . It's really just good, it's fun, it's great. So, I should have read that earlier. But Brent Weeks was on the ball, and he got a cover blurb. So yeah, Brent took care of us.",
      "#### Brandon Sanderson",
      "Understood.",
      "#### Question",
      "Have you done something similar in the past, and/or do you know any writers that just have the utmost trouble with actually writing something? It's not about a writer's block, where you don't know what to write. It's more along the lines of a cringing feeling you get when you try to write. It just does not feel right even though you want to. Would love to hear from you.",
      "#### Brandon Sanderson",
      "Okay, this is perfect. This is a great question, okay? Here's the thing. You are in the unenviable position in that you know good writing, and you're trying to write right now. This is unenviable because when I started, I was stupid. I was a teenager, and I was not a very good reader or a very good writer. I had just discovered fantasy novels, and kind of found myself in them, and I started writing. And I had the sense of everything I did was awesome because I couldn't recognize good writing. I could, deep down, but I couldn't, you know . . . I thought everything I did was awesome. I didn't get embarrassed by my writing. A lot of people do, especially if they have a better eye for editing and a better eye for writing.",
      "What you've got to remember is writing is like any other art. You don't start off doing it the right way. It's more like playing the piano than you would think. And when you sit down to play the piano for the first few times, you're not going to be very good. You've got to push through, anyway. You've just got to write. Get a notebook, go outside, go away from the computer so you can't self edit, and sit down without any distractions and try writing longhand'that works for some people. But remember, you are not writing the perfect book, you are training yourself to write the perfect book. Just like an artist has to train himself to be an artist. Just like a baseball player has to train himself to hit the baseball. And in the future, you will get to the point that you will know how to swing at this baseball naturally. And you don't know that yet. Right now you're missing with every swing, and you recognize it. But you just have to put your dues in. You just have to work hard. You have to be willing to suck at this long enough to get good at it. All right? And you can do it, you gotta go for it. Okay?"

      "That said, I can't honestly promise that I'll do an ELANTRIS sequel. When I was writing during this period of my life (some seven years ago now), I was trying to create as many first books as possible. I was sending them all off to publishers, trying to get someone to bite on one of them so I could start a series. However, since I was a nobody, I had to write each book as a stand-alone as well. Publishers, I was told, like to get books from new authors that could stand alone or launch into a series. That way, they're not committing to anything drastic, but can monopolize on popularity if it comes.",

And, I've got so many stories that I want to tell, I don't know that I'll be able to get back to this one.

I played with a number of different combinations of Ado, but somehow ended up trying up different sounds and combinations. Thankfully, I came up with the word 'Elantris.' As soon as I wrote it down, I knew this was my city. It sounded grand without being overbearing, and it had a mythological feel to it (harkening slightly to 'Atlantis'.) I renamed the book 'THE SPIRIT OF ELANTRIS,' and proceeded.",
      "Then came time to send out the manuscript. I had had some comments on the book'people liked 'Elantris,' but the 'spirit of' was less popular. I tried several iterations, and even sent out some query letters calling the book 'THE LORDS OF ELANTRIS.' That just felt too clich' fantasy for me, however, and I eventually returned to 'THE SPIRIT OF ELANTRIS.'",
      "Finally, the book got sold. At this point, my editor (Moshe Feder) suggested that we shorten the title to simply ELANTRIS. Remembering how other people had been unimpressed with the 'spirit of,' I agreed. Now that I've seen the cover lettering and worked with it as 'ELANTRIS' for some time, I'm very pleased with the change. The new title has more zip, and makes the book sound more majestic. I still get to have a reference to my old title, as Part Three of the book is called 'The Spirit of Elantris.'",
      "Of course, even this title isn't without its problems. People have trouble spelling it when I say the title, and some think of the car named the 'Elantra.' At one panel, I even had one person miss-hear me, thinking the name of the book was 'The Laundress.' That would certainly be a different book. . . ."

      "Over on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson) I've been posting scene-by-scene statistics for my line edit of _Towers of Midnight_ (which you can see on the sidebar of my site is 85% done). I'm going through and tightening the language, with a target of trimming each chapter by ten to fifteen percent. What does that mean in practice? I can't share examples from this book, but in [this week's Writing Excuses podcast episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/07/25/) Dan, Howard, and I talk about how to do this sort of tightening revision using the first book I ever wrote, back in 1994\\. Some fans have urged me not to cut, or to release an \"author's preferred text\" edition at a later date; trust me, the version you'll see on the shelf is my preferred text. Every book I've published has gone through a similar ten to fifteen percent cut, and not because a publisher or editor demanded it. This is an integral part of my writing process, and [listening to the episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/07/25/) will show you exactly why."

      "What do you have to say to aspiring writers?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "One question I get a lot from readers is 'how do I write books myself?' So I started up a podcast called Writing Excuses in which two writing friends of mine and I get together and we just talk through various aspects of writing in a very fast-paced, enjoyable way. If people want to write books themselves, I suggest Writing Excuses to them. You just find it at writingexcuses.com or through my website.",
      "The story, about, for Vin and Elend is the story of them coming to accept each other's different worlds. Vin starts as a street urchin, and she understands that life. Elend starts off as a nobleman, and he understands that life. As they start to interact and begin to have romantic interest in one another, their two worlds sort of collide and start sucking each other into each other's worlds. Vin's progress is learning that there is a part of her that can survive in this world of nobility, and of balls, and of political intrigue. But Elend, just as much, needs to understand that there's a need to be able to survive 'on the street,' a need to be able to take care of yourself rather than being pampered. It's a role-reversal for the two of them, how it works as the series progresses.",
      "Hero of Ages is the third and final book of the Mistborn Trilogy. One of the things I love about this book is that it is the ending. I like to end things. I don't want to leave people hanging. I like my stories to come to a conclusion. I promised people at the beginning, when I was writing this series, that it would be three books: and I would give them a dramatic, powerful ending. Endings are my favorite part, honestly, of novels. In a given novel, I love telling you the ending, and Book 3 is kind of a book that is an ending itself. The entire book is an ending. It's a big climax: it's exciting, and it's powerful, and it fulfills things that have been building in the series for three books now. I was able to write the trilogy straight through when I was preparing, and so I had Book 3 drafted before Book 1 even went to press, which allowed me to really make these three novels cohesive. I have seeds in the very first few paragraphs of Book 1 to things that become climactic powerful moments in the end of book 3\\. Book 3 is just an overload of action and excitement and character climaxes and just an amazing, just, romp through this series. I'm really excited about people being able to finally read it because I've been waiting for quite a while to make good on the promises I made at the beginning.",
      "The great thing about Book 3 is that I'm introducing a completely new magic system. Each book has had its own. We'll start talking about Hemalurgy, and Steel Inquisitors, and where they come from. A lot of the origins of things that people have been wondering about since Book 1\\. The last 200 pages are just some of my favorite writing that I've ever been able to write because I was able to bring things to a head and to a close. I hope you enjoy it.",
      "And then, 18 months after I'd sent that book out, I got home'I was in grad school at that point'got home from school, checked my voicemail, and there was a phone call from a guy called Moshe Feder. A voicemail, he said 'hi, I don't know if you remember me, but you sent me a book a long time ago, in fact so long ago that your email address has now changed: it bounced when I tried to send you an email, and your phone number had changed: I got a disconnected phone number, and your address had changed: so my letters came back returned. So I Googled you and I found your grad student page: I hope this is the right Brandon Sanderson, because if it is, I want to buy your book.' And so I immediately called him back, but that's essentially how the story, essentially how it went. Thank goodness for Google and thank goodness that I decided to put my phone number up on my student page at college, because otherwise, who knows what would have happened.",
      "Every hotel desk clerk you meet probably has a book or a screenplay on the side, that starving artist sort of thing, you really, really dream about it, but you never are sure if it's actually going to happen. I got that phone call finally. I honestly just about dropped the phone and collapsed to the floor. It was a voicemail that I got, actually, I didn't talk to the editor until afterward, and I got that voicemail and my immediate thought was 'Oh, this can't be happening, this is one of my friends that's called me to try and trick me, or he doesn't really want to buy the book, he just wants to reject it in a really nice way.' My agent later told me, 'No, people don't call you to reject you, they send you a letter to reject you, and they call you to accept you.'",
      "And so I called him back and I couldn't believe it was happening. I talked to him for a good two hours, just about the book. He had actually only gotten a couple hundred pages into the manuscript. When he finally picked up the manuscript, it had been 18 months since I'd sent it to him. He finally picked it up and started reading, he said he read all night and got just a couple hundred pages into it before calling me, just wanting to make sure that it was still available, because he wanted to buy it. So I spent the next week with my head in the clouds, just completely befuddled by the fact that it was actually happening."

Should we take this to mean Shadesmar is how he travels between the worlds? Do the other worlds have different ways of accessing Shadesmar than the way(s) the people of Roshar use?",

      "Yes.",
      "Including a map in a fantasy book has become a bit of a clich' ever since Tolkien did it. But if you go back and look at what Tolkien actually did, the map that was in the book was an in-world artifact'it was something the characters carried around with them and used. So I've approached the art in my books in a similar manner. Each piece represents something that is made and used by the people in the world of the books. I think that helps give a richer feel to the world I'm creating.",
      "One thing you probably won't see me doing in future novels is including character art. I want to leave exactly how characters look up to the imagination of the reader. But I'm a big fan of the sequential art storytelling form as well, so you'll likely see me do some completely graphic novels in the future."

      "Tower Guard",
      "The Bailey's Crossroads (Washington, DC) _Towers of Midnight_ signing has come and gone, and I think all will agree it was a huge success. An estimated 400 people showed up to get books signed and hear Brandon and Harriet speak. Yet the whole affair was done after less than four hours. Most of this can be attributed to the New Signing System by Brandon Sanderson', wherein you can bring as many books as you like up the first time, but only one can be personalized. I know Brandon was concerned that this might anger some, but most seemed ok with it, and a few stuck around until the end for extra personalization. And it sure did speed up the process.",
      "Or it's possible we were just an extra-effective Tower Guard contingent.",
      "We were definitely an EAGER Tower Guard contingent. I'll admit that, rather than having one of our members wait for Brandon and Harriet's arrival as suggested by Jennifer Liang, we may have all waited down there, at one point clogging up the lanes into the store a bit, until an amused Borders employee spread us out.",
      "Bad traffic on the roads resulted in a late arrival for Brandon and Harriet, but only by about 15 minutes. In the interests of time, we were quickly ushered into the Borders break room after Harriet warmly greeted a friend of hers who lived in the area and had stopped by to see her.",
      "In the break room, we were fed sandwiches while Harriet and Brandon pre-signed store copies (for those who wanted signatures but could not stay for the event) as well as copies for the store employees. They graciously answered Tower Guard questions as they signed, about the nature of writing and publication as well as about the series itself. It was a lot of fun, but too brief, as we were already running late to start the signing. To end the pre-festivities, Harriet and Brandon both graciously signed all our Tower Guard shirts, ensuring that mine will probably never get washed.",
      "Harriet McDougal Rigney",
      "The official signing started off with a reading from the prologue by Harriet. Since they had just been in Baltimore the evening before and expected some crossover attendees, they picked a different section to read. Without naming any names and invoking the wrath of the Spoiler God, let's just say that Baltimore's reading involved a long-absent evil-doer and ours involved an old-favorite do-gooder. Having Harriet do the reading was a very special event, and I think she charmed the crowd quite well. Her southern accent also lends a certain gravitas to the words as she reads them."

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I'm a writer. This is what I do. One thing I've noticed'and I'm a big gamer, I enjoy video games'is that a lot of video game people have great ideas. They have excellent storytelling instincts. What they don't have, often, is a lot of practice doing it'you get better at telling stories by telling stories. A lot of the video games out there will have this core of awesomeness but a little bit of roughness around the edges when it comes to dialogue, making sure that the worldbuilding is rigorous, making sure that the characterizations are smooth and have nice arcs. I think that's something I can bring expertise to.",
      "One of the nice things about video games is that it's a big collaborative effort. There are certain things that a writer like myself should not be involved in. I don't have any practice coming up with fun ways to play games. I know some writers who assume that because they know how to tell stories, they'll be able to make a game that's interesting, but that's certainly not the case. The developers at ChAIR are experts at making really fun, awesome games. But I can help them with their worldbuilding, making sure it's consistent; with their dialogue, making sure that it's both evocative and interesting without being cliched and overdone. I think that the more people with skill in various areas you have working on a project like this, the better the outcome will be.",
      "How did you get involved with Infinity Blade?",
      "#### Brandon Sanderson",
      "They approached me. The developers of Infinity Blade were fans of mine. They tell me they spent some six months trying to get hold of me, going through different channels. But they kept trying because they really wanted to work with me. Eventually they realized they had a contact with Isaac Stewart, who has done a lot of art for my books and is a good friend of mine. So through him they eventually got me to dinner to pitch working on this project with them.",
      "Probably Final Fantasy 10 as I mentioned. At that time I was working the graveyard shift at a hotel, and I was doing a lot of writing on my own trying to get published. I would come home every morning at seven a.m. and play for a couple of hours alone in the quiet apartment, thinking about my own stories, experiencing the story of the game.",
      "Other than that, I would say, honestly, the game that sucked most of my time was probably the original X-Wing game, which really made me feel like I got to be an X-Wing pilot, which, you know'Star Wars geek! That was so much fun! In a lot of ways every space game since then has failed to live up to the sense that I got from that game."

      "They say you can't judge a book by its cover. I've always wondered who 'They' are, and if'by chance'they've never heard of Michael Whelan. Because my experience in life has been very different.",
      "It's been almost twenty years now since I first discovered Michael's work. I was fourteen when it happened, and I was not a reader. I'd been handed a succession of novels about young boys living in the wilderness and taking care of their pet dogs. (Which would die by the end of the book.) I disliked reading with a passion. So, when my eighth-grade teacher assigned me to do a book report, I did everything I could to get out of it.",
      "That failed. In fact, it failed so solidly that the teacher'unwilling to let me choose my own book to read, for fear I'd choose something not up my reading level'steered me to the back of the room, where she kept a group of ratty paperbacks to loan out to students. You probably know the type'ripped, stained by spaghetti sauce from cafeteria lunches, pages folded and worn. I was told I had to read one of these and had to do a book report on them'and she'd read them all, so she'd know if I tried to fake it.",
      "Sullen and annoyed, I began to sift through the books. Most looked terrible. I resigned myself to another dead dog story, but then one of the books actually caught my eye. It had this vivid painting of a dragon standing in the mists, a woman held limply in its hand. _Dragonsbane_, by Barbara Hambly. The painting was so beautiful, so realistic yet imaginative, that I snatched it up, actually a little eager to look through the pages. I ended up taking it home with me.",
      "I read that book in one day. It wasn't like anything I'd ever tried reading before. (I had never been introduced to fantasy novels.) _Dragonsbane_ was amazing, challenging, imaginative, gripping, and beautiful all wrapped up in one. I remember a severe bout of disappointment upon finishing the book because I thought surely there couldn't be anything else like it in the entire world.",
      "Still, hopeful, I visited the school library the next day. I looked through the card catalog, and picked the next book'alphabetically by title'after _Dragonsbane_. It was called _Dragonflight_, by Anne McCaffrey. I went and pulled it out, and was once again captivated by the cover. I took it home and read it.",
      "My life changed. Now, we throw around sentences like that in writing, using them over and over again until they become as worn as the shoes of a traveling salesman'hardly capable of holding meaning any longer. But let me say it again. My life changed.",
      "I devoured every Anne McCaffrey book in the school library. Suddenly, what I'd discovered in _Dragonsbane_ wasn't a single, freak event. There was a pattern. If two authors could do this, perhaps there were others. Hungry for more, I went to the bookstore and discovered there was an entire fantasy genre.",
      "There were so many books. Which to choose? Dragons had treated me well so far, so I looked for some dragon books. And there, right on the shelf, was a beautiful book called _Dragon Prince_. I consumed it, and then everything else Melanie Rawn was writing.",
      "What do these books all share? It wasn't just the dragons; it was the covers. Each time, there was something dramatic and special about them. I now own prints of _Dragonsbane_ and several of Melanie's covers. All were painted by Michael Whelan.",
      "By the time Tad Williams' _Dragonbone Chair_ came out, I could recognize Michael's art on sight. And I also knew to trust it. It didn't seem logical'you really shouldn't be able to judge a book by its cover. But a Whelan cover became a seal of approval to me, a sign that the publisher trusted the book so much that they got the best person available to do the cover.",
      "I can't tell you all of the authors Whelan's art led me to over the years: Patricia Mckillip, Joan D. Vinge, Stephen Donaldson, and even Asimov. (Yes, you read that right. I first picked up Asimov because Whelan had done the new Foundation covers.)",
      "I remember when winter 1993 rolled around. My local bookseller noted to me that Whelan had a new art book coming out, one half dedicated to covers, one half dedicated to his fine art. It was the only thing I requested for Christmas, and my parents bought it for me despite the cost. I spent hours leafing through the wonderous, fantastic art. Those imagines sparked things in my mind. I was an author in embryo, absorbing, thinking, dreaming. One of the very first stories I ever wrote was a 'fanfic' based on Whelan's Passage series of fine art prints.",
      "The years have passed. There are other wonderful fantasy artists out there'and, in a way, the market has finally caught up to Whelan (much as the fantasy genre itself needed time to catch up to Tolkien.) I've been lucky to have some of those incredible artists paint covers for my books. But I've rarely felt as much excitement, wonder, and awe as I did the when I got to open an email and see the cover for _The Way of Kings_.",
      "Irene Gallo (Tor's art director) asked me to provide a quote about how I feel having a Whelan cover on one of my books. My editor, Moshe, noted 'Surely you'll mention how it's a dream come true for both you and your editor.' But 'Dream come true' is another one of those phrases we use so often it has lost its meaning.",

By the definition of the term, it's not a _deus ex machina_ as long as what's possible and what someone can do has been foreshadowed. For example, at the end of book five when Rand goes to Caemlyn and brings Mat back to life using balefire, that would only be _deus ex machina_ if the reader didn't know ahead of time that it was possible. But once you have the ability to rewind time, some really funky plotting things can happen. There are certainly criticisms that can be leveled. But _deus ex machina_ is the wrong term.</div>",

We got back to the Borders at about 5:30 or so and acquired our wristbands to assure our places in line.

How do you keep them all straight in your head? And, when one project is finished, how do you choose which one to work on next?",

I stay fresh by jumping between projects; it's the way I've (for better or worse) trained myself. And so I always have a lot of ideas, and there are a lot of things I've worked on.",
      "One thing to keep in mind with me is that, because of the way I work, some of these things just don't end up turning out.

The band may do a lot of playing, jamming, and recording'and then they pick the very best to present to their listeners.",

      "both Shakespeare and Pratchett make for a more compelling piece of art.  It seems to me that a lot of literary writing these days only wants to do a couple of things with their writing.  The same things.  Over and over. \r\n\r\nI didn't mean this to be a rant against the literary establishment.  They've received condemnations from authors far more important",
      "and eloquent",

      "[Morgan (15 June 2009)](http://bordersblog.com/scifi/2009/06/15/brandon-sanderson/travel-guide-to-medieval-europe/)",
      "**Travel Guide to Medieval Europe**",
      "Why are so many fantasy settings based on medieval Europe? The journeys through these new worlds seem familiar because they have this common root ancestor. There are exceptions, such as Daniel Abraham's _Long Price Quartet_ or Jane Lindskold's _Thirteen Orphans_, but they tend not to catch on in a big way.",
      "One of my favorite non-European settings is Stephen King's _Dark Tower_ world. This apocalyptic Old West is one of the most unique landscapes in speculative fiction, and it shows that the fantasy fan is willing to branch out. Granted, the Stephen King name helps. There's also Star Wars, which is as much fantasy as science fiction. It features a traditional fantasy plot (rescuing the princess and overthrowing an evil empire) in an outer space setting.",
      "So what other cultures or time periods are ripe for a fantasy interpretation? I'd vote for Shogun-era Japan.",
      "Anyway, as the 90's passed, more and more 'teen' or 'YA' sections started appearing in bookstores and libraries in order to provide a place for teens to go find books without having to enter the dreaded children's section. About the same time, interestingly, fantasy fiction was invaded by a plethora of fantastic YA and middle grade fantasy novels. _His Dark Materials_ has been brought up, so has Harry Potter. I'm partial to Garth Nix's work as well, and they're just the tip of a mound of very good, excellently worldbuilt fantasy novels that appeared in the late 90's and early 2000's.",
      "As someone working in this genre, all of this leaves me to wonder and speculate. Did the increasing prominence of YA sections add to this explosion? Was it all the Harry Potter bubble? Or were people jumping ship from traditional epic to YA because epic was beginning to feel stale? Perhaps it was all of this.",
      "I think it made the genre better. I think we've had to look at our sluggish beginnings in epic, and realize that two hundred pages of wandering around a castle before conflict appears may not be the best way to begin a story. We've had to become more creative in our worldbuilding, partially (I think) to compete with the elegance of YA competition. Probably, most epic authors don't even think about this, though I bet many of them have read Potter and the others. You can't help but react to, incorporate, and learn from what you read.",
      "What do you all think? What are your favorite YA fantasy novels, and how do they compare to your favorite epic fantasy novels? Am I just searching for correlation where there is none, or is my speculation on to something?"

      "So, in that regard, you know, thinking about the tools of the internet, the possibilities of harnessing so many different voices via a social network, or so on, how do you feel about the concept of shared worlds and collaborative writing?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Um, it's interesting. I think you can do some very different things with the internet that you couldn't have done before. Everyone I've talked to who's collaborated on a book has told me that collaborating is twice the work for half the money. And some people's minds work pretty well that way; they work as a team. I mean, Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven obviously work very well as a team; some of their greatest fiction came when they worked together, and the internet can allow for some of that, but I'm also skeptical at the same time because I've seen...I don't know. One of the things that's great about novels, that you don't get in other story-telling mediums—particularly you don't get in television or movies, which is our dominant story-telling medium right now—is a single person's vision, and that has its own foibles, and it has its own benefits, but when you read one of my books, you are reading _my_ vision for a story. I may have gotten feedback on it, I may have had an editor tell me, \"Hey, you should do this; you should do that,\" but every word that gets changed is changed by me. Everything that happens is done by me. And reading about the movie industry, there's some great movies that come out, but they're hugely collaborative works, and it seems that sometimes that so many people getting their fingers in the pie makes a movie end up losing some of its magic and vision.",
      "Of course not always—there are fantastic films—but some time if you want to have an interesting time, read the essay \"[Building the Bomb](http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp15.Building.the.Bomb.html)\" by Terry Rossio. Terry Rossio is a famous screenwriter—he did the _Pirates of the Caribbean_ movies; he did the _Aladdin_ screenplay with his writing partner together—and he wrote a series of essays talking about the process, and this one is now like ten years old, but it talks about the creation of the _Puppet Masters_ movie, the classic Heinlein novel turned into a movie—I think it's _The Puppet Masters_; it's one of the Heinlein scripts—but he loved the book, and he adapted it, and it goes through, step-by-step, how the life got torn out of that script because of the different people who wanted to be part of the project, not for artistic reasons, but because they wanted their names attached to it, or they wanted this person involved, or they wanted that, and it can kinda scare you sometimes what happens. I'm shocked that the artists in Hollywood—the screenwriters and the visionary directors and cinematographers, and people—are actually able to get anything artistic created, considering how much they have to go through.",

It certainly seems to imply, however, that the title Dragon is not completely exclusive to Rand, but does put it outside the realms of possibility for Demandred. Kind of a frustrating answer in terms of settling the debate, but interesting nonetheless.",
      "As to my wild (but not quite looney) theory, I'm wondering if it isn't possible that someone else will actually end up fulfilling Rand's role at the end of the series. It would be a huge bait and switch and possible unsatisfying for us, but there does seem to be a possibility, both in terms of the Logain prophecy of glory, and in terms of the original conception of the series, in that the Chosen One couldn't do it for whatever reason and someone else had to step in. To my mind, from both Brandon's playful manner and his reply, it certainly seems as if something from AMOL ties into this. Then again, I might be reading too much into a smile and a nod."

She doesn't seem to have anything to talk about.\" And I said, \"Maybe she's trying to show her that she knows her way around herbal remedies.\" So a major piece of Nynaeve's character slid into place with that.",

      "The Book Smugglers",
      "You create some of the most elaborate magic systems in fantasy today; these systems function as intrinsic parts of your worlds and characters. Typically, how do you address the different types of magic systems in your different books? Do you define these systems before you start writing the books, or do they evolve and develop as you go along?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "The answer to that is yes! It's different for every book. With my Cosmere books—which are the shared universe of my epic fantasies—I need to be a little more rigorous. There are fundamental underlying principles that guide the magic systems, and so there's a larger developmental phase before I start writing the book. Then I stick more strictly to the rules I've given myself.",
      "All the way back in 2007, I was writing one of my epic fantasies, and it just wasn't working. I needed a break to something creative, different, and distinctive. So I jumped ship, abandoning that epic fantasy, and wrote _The Rithmatist_ instead, which had a lot less planning than one of my epic fantasies.",
      "With something like _The Rithmatist_—which is outside the Cosmere—I'm allowed a little more freedom, which is one of the reasons I like writing books like this, where I allow myself to develop it as I write. The magic was the first thing that got me excited about _The Rithmatist_, so I based the book around it.",
      "The first thing I wrote was the scene—now late in chapter one—where Joel watches Fitch get defeated by Nalizar in the classroom. It started out on a chalkboard, but I eventually moved it to the floor because that made more sense. As I was writing these chapters, I developed the Rithmatic lines and let the story feed the magic and the magic feed the story in a way that some writers call \"discovery written.\"",
      "I've often said that great stories are about great characters first. But beyond that, science fiction stories are about ideas and fantasy stories are about the setting. I think that's why when I come up with a great idea story, I write it as science fiction. If I come up with some interesting setting element, like a great magic system, I write it as fantasy. I've found that getting across an interesting and complex magic system in a very short amount of time is extraordinarily hard, so it tends to work better for longer stories.",
      "I believe that children and teens are better able to mode shift. When they pick up a book, they don't necessarily feel that it has to fit in one of the genre boxes. As an author, that allows you to do some interesting things in teen that are harder to do within an adult genre."

      "Question",
      "A lot of your work deals with stereotypes. Can you tell us more about that?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "It's true, but I always make sure that it isn't just about the stereotype. It's a fun thing to challenge some of the classic fantasy models, but that shouldn't take over the writing as that can really undermine a writer. Piers Anthony was an example where the puns were fun but eventually came to undermine the series. I like having non-stereotypical professions and I enjoyed challenging age perceptions in _Way of Kings_. Having a romance between a man in his 50s and a woman in her late 40s is unusual in fantasy, where it's all about the young man falling in love.",
      "In the case of Feruchemy, no energy is being drawn from this other place. So, you spend a week sick and store up the ability to heal. It's a balanced system, basically obeying the laws of thermodynamics. So, while it's not real, it's still rational.",
      "In compounding, when you have the power of both Allomancy and Feruchemy, you draw power from the other place through the metal and it recognizes the power that is already stored'\"Oh, this is healing, I know how to do that''and so you get the power of Feruchemy but boosted by energy from the other place. This is how the Lord Ruler achieved immortality."

      "I know you're past this now, but would you ever consider something like the Patreon? Is that something that you would've done ten years ago, if it existed?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Yeah, I might have... Patreon is kind of a hard thing, because I think Patreon is much better for people who are doing something that may be not as market-friendly, but which a group thinks is very important and should be rewarded. There are certain authors I know whose work is very important to the field, like Nora Jemison. Nora's work is really important, and it's really good, but... and it's sold pretty well, but I think that the idea of \"(???) have to be market-friendly\" is really terrifying to Nora... maybe not terrifying, I don't think anything terrifies Nora. But you know, it's that she doesn't want to be beholden to that, and so her setting up a Patreon said, \"look, I'm just gonna write this stuff, I don't even have to worry about the market\", is really good use of Patreon. We set one up for Writing Excuses, and then we use the money to pay our guests, and to fly people in and stuff like that. I don't need one because what I write naturally does very well in the market and so there's no need or worry for me to do that. If all writing shifted in that direction I'd be fine with it, but for right now what's working here with me is working just fine...",
      "#### Question",
      "Yeah, the traditional model for publishing really serves you...",

      "Yeah. The traditional model works very well when you're someone like me. My plots and my stories and things just connect very well with a large segment of the population. (pauses) It's also why I don't do a lot on Kickstarter, like I think Kickstarter's- like we did, we let people making this one board game - which, by the way, Mistborn Board Game, yeah, you guys kickstarted that very well - I let them Kickstart that, they're like a small company that makes the board game, and I said, \"you can make the board game, but you have to get a really good designer, because I can't micromanage making a board game\", and so they get it, and that's somebody very expensive, and then they Kickstarted, you guys supported that. I think that's a good use of Kickstarter for someone like me, but Kickstarter ain't just something of my own, I'd rather Kickstarter be used by people who maybe need it a bit more, so I've stayed away from doing this thing for now."

Pattern is certain that Shallan will choose to kill him in the future, but I don't remember him saying the Radiants were 'wicked.' That doesn't really fit with what we know of cryptics anyway. He went dormant when Shallan ignored him, but why would he think she would go even further and 'kill' him when his standards are much different than honorspren? Also, the big troop of Radiants who abandoned their swords in Dalinar's vision all did it at once. Their swords and armor were glowing and functioning when they arrived, so not oathbroken yet, and they do it in mass right then. Why would they choose that? (And weren't many of them Windrunners?) I think the Listener verse about the Parshendi being milk to the spren as opposed to the meat provided by bonds to men hints at the answer. We know that the spren imitated what the heralds could do and initiated the bonds on their own. I think that there is a cost to the Nahel bond that is undisclosed'the spren are somehow feeding/draining something'life, magic, etc. from their partners. They have good intentions and/or view short human live through a different lens of priorities in perspective of the millenia long struggle with Odium, but the humans pay a steep cost in exchange for their increased abilities. Maybe they eventually drain and become spren themselves?",

      "We've gone far more realistic these days in fantasy art than Darrell's style was complimentary toward. However, when I first got into fantasy books, the covers were not like what we had today. The genre was still in its infancy, and fantasy illustration was equally youthful. Publishers were still trying to figure out how to illustrate it. We usually either got conceptual covers like the sf ones you can find on [this thread](http://www.sffchronicles.co.uk/forum/36693-classic-science-fiction-covers.html) or, far worse, the dreaded woman in a chain mail bikini—a trope I consider downright stupid in a genre almost universally populated with strong female protagonists.",
      "(Note that I don't intend this as a dismissal of Frazetta or Vallejo. Though I wouldn't consider myself a fan of that style, often their art was on the right books. A Conan cover SHOULD have art like that. However, this style (as seen in [this link](http://www.goodshowsir.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/annedragon.jpg)) was even prevalent on things like the Pern books, where it didn't belong.)",

I didn't have passion about anything, I was just kind of wandering. And then, I discovered fantasy novels. And it's dumb to say, but fantasy novels changed my life. I don't know why. Now, as a 37-year-old, I can look back and say \"Well, obviously, it was THIS\" But I don't know what it was. I discovered specifically _Dragonsbane_, the works of Anne McCaffrey, and the works of Melanie Rawn. Which were right after one another in the card catalog, and they all three had Michael Whelan covers. And I don't know why, but those three things grabbed me, and then I realized this is what I wanted to do. I realized this is a job people do, and it's awesome. So I told my Mom, and she said \"Well, you better get better grades, then.\" That's what my Mom does, she's an accountant. And I got straight As in 9th grade. I did. Because I'm like, I now know why I'm doing this, and I have to be literate if I'm going to be an author. So it's hokey to say \"Fantasy novels saved my life\".

I'm like 'Here I write all these books about people protecting the world with their powers and what would I do if I had them? I'd be blowing up people because they inconvenience me.' *laughter* And this is where the series came from, I thought about that the entire rest of the drive, which was about another hour. And I thought 'What if-- What could we do if people just started manifesting superpowers and-- You couldn't throw them in prison, or if you did they'd just break out. You couldn't defeat them with the armies. What would the society do if there were legitimately superpowered individuals?' It's kind of the same tactic that Watchmen took, if you've ever read that, but it kind of goes the other direction with 'They are all evil, what do we do?'

      "#### Henry L. Herz",
      "Indeed, I cannot underscore enough the value of belonging to a good critique group. I would also offer up Brandon's Laws (again from Wikipedia):",
      "\"Sanderson's First Law is that \"An author's ability to solve conflict satisfactorily with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic.\" While originally created as a rule for magic systems in fantasy novels, Sanderson has specified that this law need not apply just to fantasy, but is also applicable to science fiction. This Law was originally defined in Sanderson's online essay \"Sanderson's First Law\". In the essay he qualifies the two extremes of design as being:",
      "1\\. Magic/technology has well defined rules that the audience understands. As a result, one can use this to solve conflict more easily as the capabilities are cleanly defined. Sanderson classifies this as \"Hard Magic\". C.L. Wilson in her essay \"Worldbuilding 101 — Making Magic\" advocated this method of creation, stating, \". . . create your rules, then follow them.\"",
      "2\\. Magic/technology has unclear or vague rules, or none at all. This allows for a greater sense of wonder to be attained for the reader, but the ability to solve problems without resorting to _deus ex machina_ decreases. Sanderson classifies this as \"Soft Magic\". Lawrence Watt-Evans specifically advised \"The trick is to be a benevolent and consistent deity, not one who pulls miracles out of a hat as needed.\"",
      "Sanderson's Second Law is \"Limitations > Powers\", that a character's weaknesses are more interesting than his or her abilities. It was initially set down in Episode 14 of the podcast _Writing Excuses_. John Brown, likewise looked to Sanderson's work in his own essay involving magic systems, noting \"What are the ramifications and conflicts of using it?\" Patricia Wrede likewise noted several issues on this topic ranging from magic suppressing other technologies, to how a magic might affect farming. In explaining the second law, Sanderson references the magic system of Superman, claiming that Superman's powers are not what make him interesting, but his limits, specifically his vulnerability to kryptonite and the code of ethics he received from his parents.",
      "Sanderson's Third Law is that a writer should \"Expand what you already have before you add something new.\"",
      "Sanderson's Last Law is that a good magic system should be interconnected with the world around it. Sanderson points out that magic does not take place in a vacuum. It is related to the ecology, religion, economics, warfare, and politics of the world it inhabits. The job of the author is to think farther than the reader about the ramifications of the magic system. If magic can turn mud into diamonds, that has an effect on the value of diamonds. Sanderson states that readers of genre fiction are interested not just in the magic system but how the world and characters will be different because of the magic.\""

      "I am curious if professional writers ever get psyched out by their own works. When you are working on an epic series, such as 'The Stormlight Archive', do you ever have moments of doubt in your ability to see it through to completion? Does it ever feel overwhelming that you have so many volumes ahead of you to write?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "That's not the part that psychs me out. Length doesn't do that to me, particularly when I have a series well planned and I have a feel for how each book is going to be distinctive. This really helped me with the Mistborn series, for instance-when I planned it out, I planned each book to have its own identity. That kept me interested in them.",
      "No, what psychs me out is that sometimes something just turns out really well, like _The Way of Kings_, and then I immediately start thinking, \"I have to do that again, and I don't know how I did it in the first place.\" Writing becomes a very instinctive thing.",
      "Most of the time when I talk about the process of writing, I'm analyzing what I've done after the fact. The truth of it is that right in the moment, right when you're sitting there working on a book, a lot of that stuff isn't going through your head. You're just running on instinct at that point. So it's easy to get psyched out when you're not sure if you can ever do it again.",
      "So it's hard to say \"better book\"/\"not better book.\" I think \"always learning and growing\" is a better way to put it than getting better with each book."

      "Reading Sanderson's latest release, a blockbuster of a thriller entitled _Steelheart_ (out September 24), will have fans of superhero fantasy feeling like they've stumbled into their own Herbal Essences commercial (\"Yes, yes, yes!\"). It's a mind-blowing experience—easily one of the most satisfying novels I've read all year.",
      "Set in a near future where the appearance of a bright red star in the sky (known as Calamity) has given some ordinary people extraordinary powers, this novel—which is the first installment of his Reckoners series—is nothing short of a masterwork.",
      "The story is kick ass—it's breakneck paced and action packed. Subtle foreshadowing and allegory abound. The chapters are relatively short and all end with cliffhangers. As the story progresses, Sanderson begins revealing jaw-dropping plot twists. Everything comes together in a climax that will have readers not only standing up and applauding but instantly agonizing because they now have to wait a year until the next novel (_Firefight_) is released.",
      "Bottom line: _Steelheart_ is an absolute must-read for anyone who is a fan of superhero fiction. And while it's marketed as a young adult read (ages 12 and up), it's not really so much a young adult novel as a novel that can be read and enjoyed by young adults.",

As time went by I kept looking over at the line to the side where it wrapped through the bookshelves. I kept hoping for some sign that we were nearing the end. Finally I saw it, the end of the line. My girlfriend was at home watching us on ustream and sent me a text wondering why we were all suddenly looking behind us. It was amusing how everything stopped or that one moment as we all realized the end was in sight. At the same time though was a touch of sadness at knowing that this great night was coming to an end. Finally shortly before midnight, almost five hours after the official start of the signing, the last person in line stepped up to the table, greeted by a round of applause. We got our stuff packed up, and the Tower Guard finally got to get their books signed. Brandon tried to skip numbering mine as a test, but I caught it one last time."

He read parts of Wax/Wayne 2, Legion 2, and the Taravangian interlude in WoR. There weren't a lot of cosmeric goodies, but I did get a couple interesting tidbits in relation to Mistborn: Ruin would have had to manifest to reabsorb the atium, the Well of Ascension did not come at a price to Preservation's power, and perhaps the most interesting one. Burned metals are turned into a different form, and will eventually return to the planet. The Pits of Hath sin are meant to foreshadow this.",

      "Killing off the army like this was planned from the beginning. I knew I needed some kind of big wrench in the plans of the crew, and figured this would make a pretty good one. Plus, it felt natural, since it was a problem with Kelsier's own growing reputation. The very thing he's been working so hard to foster eventually turned against him.",
      "When alpha readers read this chapter, they didn't see the loss of the army as much of a setback. That was one of the first things that made me realize the big flaw in the early drafts. I'd talked a lot in the crew about stealing the atium, but I'd spent all the time with them actually doing things on recruiting the army. So, the readers were still focused on the job being the atium heist, rather than the capture of the city. In that context, losing the army isn't all that bad.",
      "So, I like how the rewrite focuses much more on the army. It makes the events of this chapter all the more poignant. Yeden, the one that was employing the crew, is dead. That should mean the end of everything.",
      "The same is true for Allomancy. The vast majority of Allomancers aren't powerful enough to look beyond the basics. For them, simple rules like \"You can't Push on metals inside of someone's body\" apply. It's much easier to tell someone that, as opposed to \"People's bodies interfere with Allomancy, making it much harder to affect metals inside of them—so hard, in fact, that only some people you'll never meet can Push on metals inside of people's bodies.\"",
      "It is a matter of degree of power. Vin, for reasons I'll explain eventually, has access to far more Allomantic power than regular people. The Lord Ruler is the same way, though for different reasons. And so, he can affect metals that are blocked by blood. Vin has to draw upon another, external source of power in order to produce the same effect, but it is possible for her.",
      "Narratively, I worry that this looks too much like I'm breaking my own rules. However, I had to balance drama with effect in this chapter, and eventually decided that I could make it work. I've established throughout the book that there are flaws in the commonly-perceived laws of Allomancy. There are metals nobody knows about. You can pierce copperclouds. In fact, one of the unwritten laws of Allomancy is that it isn't understood as well as everyone seems to think.",

The Way of Kings was the book I wrote after that, giving no care to the world, writing only from my heart--and so you can say I've already started doing that. I would like to point out, though, that the second version of Mistborn (the one that got published, in which I tossed aside everything but the magic system and some original character concept) as in my mind a 'return to form' of the books like Elantris that I'd been writing and feeling were not getting attention.",

They're just too short, in my opinion, for a traditional bookstore release. (Though I originally did do one of them with Tor.com.) I wanted to release nice collector's edition print versions and cheap ebooks at the same time. It's not something that is profitable for a large publisher, and so is better suited to doing myself. (EDIT--Note, with Legion and The Emperor's Soul, I'm working with very talented small presses for the print editions and am self publishing the ebooks. I don't want to take credit for what Subpress and Tachyon are doing, as they've been fantastic to work with. I love the Tachyon cover.)",

However, considering the company, it seems like a great place to be. I'm a firm believer that both indy publishing and big-six publishing will have a place in the future of books, and that both serve very useful roles.

      "Now for a bonus question: From your experience teaching creative writing, what is some advice you give your students?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "The biggest piece of advice I would give them is: You just gotta finish stuff. A lot of people want to be writers. And a lot of people have really great ideas. And get their great ideas together and say, \"Wow! I think this could be a book.\" Then they start on it and for various reasons, they stop. One of the main reasons is they get discouraged because it's not turning out as they want it to turn out, or they get distracted by another really great idea they've just had, or they want to go back and keep revising this initial stuff that they've written. And you've got to finish. You won't understand how to be a writer until you actually finish a book. And you've got to remember that nobody starts off being perfect. And it's that process of writing books that aren't so good that teaches you how to write books that are good. No one expects to sit down and play the piano perfectly the first time. Yet a lot of people sit down and try to write the perfect book the first time. So, my biggest piece of advice to them is: Sit down, write, finish a book. And that will teach you how to write a good book.",
      "#### Matthew Peterson",
      "Ah. That's some good advice.",
      "Do you still do that? Even with all this on your plate?",
      "#### Brandon Sanderson",
      "I still do it. But I only teach one class a year nowadays. So, it only lasts for about three months. But I feel a need to do that because it was in that class when I was an undergraduate, long ago, that I got the final bit of information I needed, it was the final kick in the pants, so to speak, to go get published.",
      "#### Matthew Peterson",
      "Oh.",
      "#### Brandon Sanderson",
      "It was taught by David Farland at the time who was just doing what I'm doing. He was a professional writer. He was just stepping in to teach the class for a few years. And he gave me real world publishing advice, gave the whole class real world publishing advice. A lot of creative writing classes are very touchy feely. That's a good thing; they'll talk about the feel of writing and how to grow a story and all of this stuff. But Dave was the first one that came in and said, \"Look, you can do this for a living. I'm going to tell you how and we're going to talk about the nuts and bolts of creating a story.\" And that was wildly useful to me. And so I feel a need to go back, when I have the opportunity and explain to new writers, those same sorts of things.",

      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Yes, it is. I actually wrote _Alcatraz_ between _Mistborn_ books two and three. I had just finished book two, and I wanted to push in and do book three, but I was feeling a little exhausted, almost a little burnt out, and I didn't want to start the final book feeling burnt out. And so, not telling anybody what I was doing, I took some time off, and I wanted to do something very different to encourage myself to grow as an artist, to explore different types of writing. Like I said normally I'm an architect, and I wanted to do a more gardener-type book. For _Alcatraz_ I started with a few premises that I found amusing and interesting and I built a book out of them, as I went. It turned out very well—a lot of my projects that I experiment with, I actually don't publish because they don't turn out very well. I only take the ones that really turn out well and publish them.",
      "So for every _Alcatraz_, there's two or three other novels that just kind of nose-dived. That doesn't happen with my epic fantasies because I spend so long planning them and getting them ready that I know, before I start, how they're going to turn out.",
      "But anyway, _Alcatraz_ was a light-hearted, fun—but hopefully still interesting and intriguing—story for me to write, about a young man who discovers that librarians secretly rule the world!",
      "So I think my religion affects me to be fascinated in these concepts, so religious concepts are in my books. I like to hope that I'm approaching them from lots of different and interesting aspects, but the nature of faith, the nature of hope, the nature of rational thought versus faithful thought: these different things are very fascinating to me, and so they tend to be fascinating to my characters.",

I'm not much like Kelsier: he is too gregarious, he is not me, but there's a little bit of me in all of them I suppose.</div>"

      "#### Harriet McDougal",
      "Yes, using his work was a big expense for a little company. It was one of the ways in which you did such a superb job of publishing. Also, what's so nice about the gorgeous Michael Whelan cover for the last book is that it's obviously a Michael Whelan, but he very tactfully made it so that when you rack them all out, they look like family. That was a lovely thing he did.",
      "#### Irene Gallo",
      "It is. He did a good job. The palette and compostion really works with the other covers. I didn't envy him the job and he turned it into a nice tribute as well as a conclusion.",
      "#### Harriet McDougal",
      "And Sam Weber is so nice. I keep trying to call him Sam Weller because of Dickens. He said Whelan called him once and asked: \"What's a _ter'angreal_?\"",
      "Looking at _[The Way of Kings](http://www.tor.com/tags/the%20way%20of%20kings)_, I had an extraordinary coincidence. A friend of mine's former wife is a curator at the Phillips Collection in Washington. She's a descendent of John Martin, an English painter also known as [Mad Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Martin_%28painter%29). He was the highest paid artist in Great Britain in the 1840's, and then he sank into total obscurity until a couple of war refugees rediscovered and resurrected his works after World War II. [One of his paintings](http://inkbloodmagic.blogspot.com/2011/06/john-martin.html) is the cover of _The Way of Kings_, except that there's a big pantheon where the guy is in the distance.",

      "His skies are very much like Michael Whelan's. He was doing all that stuff way back then. I don't know if Whelan's ever looked at him, but it looks as if he has. Those fabulous skies of Whelan's.",
      "It's hard to say. I came on in '93, when Maria [Mellili, former Art Director for Tor Books] was here. It was already the big book of the year. Many of the cover decisions were set. My earliest memories were that the production schedules were set by hours, not days.",
      "#### Harriet McDougal",
      "Really?",
      "#### Irene Gallo",
      "There would always be four different versions of the production schedule, based on what day it came in. Contingency plans on top of contingency plans.",
      "#### Harriet McDougal",
      "For one of the books, Jim and I stayed at the Murray Hill Hotel, with twin laptops. He'd do a chapter and give it to me, I'd read and edit it, and then I'd bring a disk in. I had a terrific carryall I'd bought at the Morgan Library, but it was not up to carrying my laptop and gave up the ghost in the middle. That was, I think, the craziest.",
      "#### Irene Gallo",
      "I remember Jeff Dreyfus, our production manager at the time, spent the days walking back and forth from the office to the hotel.",
      "#### Harriet McDougal",
      "And Jim ended up having to stay up here to proofread. It was going to take a week or more, and I had to go back and deal with stuff at home. That's funny about the production schedules by hour, though. I'd never heard that.",
      "#### Irene Gallo",
      "They would set up four of them: if it comes on Monday, it's this, but if it comes in late Tuesday, it's this.",
      "#### Tom Doherty",
      "But hey, you know, it worked. We did a book each year, and each book built. By the time we got to the fourth book, we were selling the first book in mass market paperback. It was hooking people and bringing them in. Then the next book would grow, because people wouldn't want to wait."

I keep promising it, and I'm usually very good at meeting my promises on deadlines, but I'm touring so much this year. I've had to tell the fans, \"I have to support the books that are out there, and you all want to see me, and you all invite me to conventions.\" I have to learn how to manage that better, because since January, I've basically only been home for about two months. I'm out there all the time, all over the place.",
      "It's tough. I have to write. I had to write 3,000 words on the plane yesterday, and writing on the plane is not easy, but I'm going to have to write a big chunk of this book on this tour. Grit my teeth and go.",

That makes it more reasonable that we'll get them every year. I really think every 18 months is more likely, but I don't want the readers to have to wait. You know, as much as I respect the guy, I don't want to do a George R. R. Martin thing to people, where it's four years between books. That's just too long to keep all these characters for a big epic fantasy in mind.",

      "One of the characters from _Elantris_ is in _The Way of Kings_, just in one chapter. And one of the characters from _Mistborn_ is in _The Way of Kings_. There is crossover. It's never going to be the forefront of the series. I don't want you to have to have read _Mistborn_ to enjoy the Stormlight Archive, but if you have, and you really want to get into these things, you can find all the clues connecting all the worlds. It's a story hidden behind the story. Someday I'll write its own dedicated series for it. But again, it's important for me that I make sure that fans don't have to have read my entire breadth of work in order to enjoy a given series. It has to stand on its own.",
      "#### Tom Doherty",
      "Well, I think we've got something special going. It isn't often I can't wait for the next book. I've got too much to read.",

The fact that she hadn't yet seen the real cover art makes this all seem even more fishy to me. Looking closely, that posted art really lacks detail. After getting some internal emails from Tor, I'm really thinking that my conclusion last night was true. This is not the cover, but a rough mock-up done quickly by production to have something to show at meetings. It was never supposed to go outside of Tor, and is NOT the final cover, not even close to it. I'll bet this is just a sketch Mr. Sweet did showing potential cover ideas. It might not even be him doing the art'it's too small to tell.",

      "I got there about 1 hour before he was to start signing books. When I went inside to purchase my book ahead of time, he was already in there, and was doing an interview for the local news station. I met a few people there, and waited for 4:00pm to roll around. We all got in line (We were assigned numbers in the order we purchased the book—I was #24.), and waited for our turn to see the man.",
      "Turns out that he was not taking any questions during the signing. He was also not personalizing any of the books—so \"he could get out of there quicker\". (As I was told by a staff member at the book store.) I was disappointed by this, as I had heard that he usually takes a few questions during the book signings, and I had heard that he was a genuinely nice guy. When I got up there, I said \"Good Afternoon.\", and held my hand out to shake his hand. He ignored my hand, and asked for my books. He signed them, and that was it. Not a single word from him at all.",
      "I was miffed, to say the least, so I left right after that. He might have done something for the fans after all of the books were signed, but by everyone at the store's, and his, attitude, I doubt it. Maybe he had an appointment to go somewhere, or his flight was scheduled soon after the book signings. But regardless, I was extremely put off by his, and the store's, attitudes about this signing.",
      "I'd like to put some of the blame on the store, but I was there when Terry Goodkind's last book came out for his signing'Mr. Goodkind was extremely nice and talkative, and he took about 5-10 minutes with each person in line. (I was 5th in line that night, and it took me 45 minutes to get to him!) Not that I was complaining, though... Therefore, I can't say that RJ's signing was caused by the store pushing him out of there; the choice must have been all on RJ's part, and that ticks me off. Especially since he's my favorite author. I'm not going to stop reading or anything, I just wanted to throw this out there, and get it off my chest.",

      "PART TWO: BUFFERS AND MY WRITING SPEED",
      "Because of this, and because of my writing style, I need a little bit of a break before I tackle it. I pushed myself very hard to get both _Towers of Midnight_ and _The Way of Kings_ ready for publication this year. Even then, it was only possible because I had written a sizable chunk of _Towers of Midnight_ while working on _The Gathering Storm_ AND because I'd already finished an early version of _The Way of Kings_.",
      "People have mentioned before that I am somewhat prolific. Some of this is an illusion. For a while now, I've been warning people that we've been chewing through my buffer at a frightening rate. Once upon a time, I would turn in a book three years before it was scheduled to come out. This gave me a lot of wiggle room. If a book wasn't working, I could shelve it and think about it, then get back to it. Working that far ahead prevents most big crunches.",
      "However, the books I've been working on lately were a little more high profile than previous ones'and high-profile books get released when they get turned in, not three years later. So, though I took eighteen months finishing _The Gathering Storm_, it looked like I finished it very quickly. (I turned it in during the summer of 2009, and it came out in the fall of 2009\\. _Warbreaker_ came out that same year, though I'd turned it in back in 2006.) The very long write of that book was invisible to a lot of readers because books I'd written years before continued to come out while I was working on it.",
      "The buffer is gone now. I'll talk more about that later. However, I want to mention something else that helps me be productive'and that's allowing myself deviations to keep myself interested. I've told people before that I wrote the _Alcatraz_ books to give me a break between _Mistborn_ novels. If I'm able to refresh myself on other projects, I don't get burned out on the big epics. (Which are my true love, but can be very demanding on me mentally.)"

If you asked a lot of authors that question, they'll say, \"Oh, I wrote my first book when I was in first grade, and ever since then I wanted to be a writer.\" Well, I didn't start off as a writer. I actually had a big period in my life where I didn't like to read, didn't like books at all. And it wasn't until I was in junior high and a teacher handed me a fantasy novel that it really all started.",

And It was so imaginative, and it had just this wonderful world of dragons and all these things; and also a story about a middle-aged woman who is struggling kind of, to choose between how much time to spend with her family and how much time to spend on her magic. And it was fascinating to me even as a junior high kid that when I finished this book I felt like I kind of understood my mother better, and yet I had this wonderful romp in a fantasy world at the same time. I look back at that and say the emotions that these books can cause are something special, because it can give us this wonderful adventure, but also can make us really understand people we would never be able to understand otherwise.",

But it was me drawing on various sources, and also just trying to make my own thing. Yes, there's certainly a Norse aspect to a lot of the weather magic and things like that, but it's more that I wanted to tell a story about a world that got hit by these magical hurricanes every few days.

I also was searching for something that would give Roshar a different feel from things that I'd done before. I wanted this book and this series—and everything about it—to feel different from fantasy worlds in the past. I wanted it to be fantastical, but I wanted it to be unique. I wanted something that could consistently remind the reader, \"Oh, I'm in a different place. Wow. Their emotions manifest visibly when they feel them strongly. This place is bizarre.\" That was one of the main inspirations. Looking in our world, one inspiration is certainly the Eastern concept in Shinto mythology of everything having a soul, every rock and river and tree having something living inside of it that is a manifestation of it. Since I was working with the idea of Platonic realms and the like, I spun that off into the spren."

It was because I loved writing, and I didn't want to stop writing to go do all this marketing stuff. And I think that actually helped me, because I got to spend a lot of time playing with my style and deciding what my impact on the genre would be. And it also taught me that even if I never got published, I would keep doing this for the rest of my life. I'd be writing a book every year. No matter what job I ended up in, that was just what I was going to do.",

And make sure that you enjoy the process. Enjoy the busy work parts of it. I went to school freshman year as a chemist. I only changed to English when my sophomore year began. And one of the reasons I made the change is that the busy work part of chemistry, I didn't enjoy. While the busy work part of writing, I loved. So, love it. And then keep at it.

      "Scott Wilson",
      "You have really broken the mold and steered away from the usual races of the fantasy genre, is there any major reason why you avoided the standard tropes, such as elves and orcs?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "A couple of reasons. Those are really two questions. Why did I avoid the standard tropes? For a long time I've felt that epic fantasy has relied too much on Tolkien, who did a wonderful job, but I feel that rather than doing what he did by creating races and mythologies and worlds of our own we've in some ways allowed ourselves to be strongly influenced by him and relied on some of the work he did. In other cases those tropes have just been overplayed and overdone by people who were very good writers and knew what they were doing. I certainly don't want to point any fingers at people like Stephen Donaldson who wrote brilliant books making use of some of the familiar tropes from Tolkien, but one of the things to remember is that when he did that they weren't familiar tropes. They were still fresh and new. The same can be said for Terry Brooks. I'm sure if I were writing back then that's what I would have done too, because we were still exploring the genre and trying to decide where it was going to go and what epic fantasy was and meant. But I feel that I belong to the generation after that. There was the generation who relied a lot on Tolkien and the generation who grew up reading those authors' books, and a lot of us in my generation of writers seem like we are reacting against the previous generations by saying, \"Okay, that's been done, and you did a good job. Where else can we take this?\" I have no interest in writing about elves or dwarves or any of these things that have been explored for the last four decades in intricate detail. I want to go my own directions.",
      "But personally, why do I include the races that I include? I'm just looking for interesting things that complement the story that I'm telling. The races in _The Way of Kings_ come directly into the story and the mystery of what's happened before. If you pay close attention to what the races are, it tells you something about what's going to happen in the future and what's happened in the past. It's very conscious. This is just me trying to explore.",
      "I feel that epic fantasy as a genre has not yet hit its golden age yet. If you look at science fiction as a genre, science fiction very quickly got into extrapolating very interesting and different sorts of things. Fantasy, particularly in the late '90s, feels like it hit a bit of a rut where the same old things were happening again and again. We saw the same stories being told, we saw the same races show up, we saw variations only in the names for those races. For me as a reader, it was a little bit frustrating because I read this and felt that fantasy should be the genre that should be able to do anything. It should be the most imaginative genre. It should not be the genre where you expect the same stories and the same creatures. If we want to approach the heights of great storytelling and take it a few more steps so that we don't just copy what Tolkien did, we do what Tolkien did, which is look to the lore ourselves and build our own extrapolations. This is playing into what I like as a reader and my own personal philosophies and hobby horses, but it really just comes down to what I think makes the best story."

Something that the fans have just missed... They pick up on so much, that it's hard... I do wonder if, you know' all the magic systems [in my books] are connected and work on some basic fundamental principles, and a lot of people haven't been asking questions about this. One thing I did get a question on today, and I'll just talk about this one... they didn't ask the right question, but I nudged them the right way, is understanding that tie between Aondor [the magic system from _Elantris_] and allomancy [_Mistborn_'s magic system].",
      "People ask about getting the power from metals and things, but that's not actually how it works. The power's not coming from metal. I talked a little about this before, but you are drawing power from some source, and the metal is actually just a gateway. It's actually the molecular structure of the metal' what's going on there, the pattern, the resonance of that metal works in the same way as an Aon does in _Elantris_. It filters the power. So it is just a sign of 'this is what power this energy is going to be shaped into and give you.' When you understand that, compounding [in _Alloy of Law_] makes much more sense.",
      "Compounding is where you are able to kind of draw in more power than you should with feruchemy. What's going on there is you're actually charging a piece of metal, and then you are burning that metal as a feruchemical charge. What is happening is that the feruchemical charge overwrites the allomantic charge, and so you actually fuel feruchemy with allomancy, is what you are doing. Then if you just get out another piece of metal and store it in, since you're not drawing the power from yourself, you're cheating the system, you're short-circuiting the system a little bit. So you can actually use the power that usually fuels allomancy, to fuel feruchemy, which you can then store in a metalmind, and basically build up these huge reservoirs of it. So what's going on there is' imagine there's like, an imprint, a wavelength, so to speak. A beat for an allomantic thing, that when you burn a metal, it says 'ok, this is what power we give.' When it's got that charge, it changes that beat and says, 'now we get this power.' And you access a set of feruchemical power. That's why compounding is so powerful.",

      "[_The Way of Kings_](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Way-of-Kings/Brandon-Sanderson/e/9781429992800?itm=1&USRI=The%20Way%20of%20Kings) is out. I've been thinking a lot about the novel, what it has meant to me over the years, and why I decided to write it as I did. I've had a lot of trouble deciding how to pitch this novel to people. It's a trouble I've never had before. I'm going to explain why this one doesn't work as easily. But I'm going to start with a story.",
      "The tone of the video is a little heavy-handed in its message. Among other things, it is meant to parody rock star/music video culture. It shows Jewel in oversexualized situations, having sold herself out in an over-the-top way. It points a critical finger at sexual exploitation of the female form in advertising, and juxtaposes Jewel in a normal, everyday walk with a surreal, Hollywood version of herself promoting various products.",
      "Now, what is absolutely fascinating to me about this video is how perfectly it launches into an discussion of the literary concept of deconstructionism. You see, Jewel is able to come off looking self-aware'even down-to-earth'in this video, because of the focus she puts on how ridiculous and silly modern advertising is. The entire video is a condemnation of selling out, and a condemnation of using sexual exploitation in advertising.",
      "And yet, while making this condemnation, Jewel gets to reap the benefits of the very things she is denouncing. In the video, her \"Hollywood self\" wears a tight corset, gets soaked in water, and prances in a shimmering, low-cut gown while wind blows her hair in an alluring fashion. She points a critical finger at these things through hyperbole, and therefore gains the moral high ground'but the video depends on these very images to be successful. They're going to draw every eye in the room, gaining her publicity in the same way the video implies is problematic.",
      "Deconstructionism is a cornerstone of postmodern literary criticism. Now, as I'm always careful to note, I'm not an expert in these concepts. A great deal of what I present here is an oversimplification, both of Jewel's video and of postmodernism itself. But for the purposes of this essay, we don't have time for pages of literary theory. The title itself is already pretentious enough. So, I'll present to you the best explanation of deconstructionism I was given when working on my master's degree: \"It's when you point out that a story is relyin' on the same thing it's denyin'.\"",
      "That will work for now.",
      "And this is why, in the end, I decided that I would not write _The Way of Kings_ as a postmodern epic. (Not intentionally, at least.) Mistborn felt, in part, like a reflection. There were many original parts, but at its core it was a study of the genre, and'to succeed at its fullest'it needed an audience who understood the tropes I was twisting about. Instead of making its own lasting impression and improvement on the genre, it rested upon the work done by others.",
      "In short, I feel that using that same process again would make it a crutch to me. There is nothing at all wrong with what Mistborn did. I'm very proud of it, and I think it took some important steps. But it's not what I want to be known for, not solely. I don't just want to reflect and study; I want to create. I want to write something that says, \"Here is my addition, my tiny step forward, in the genre that I love.\"",
      "To couch it in the terms of the Jewel video that started the essay, instead of creating a piece of art that screams, \"Hey, look at those other pieces of art and hear my take on them,\" I wanted to create something that says, \"Look at this piece of art. This is what I think art should be in this genre now.\" Part of me thinks that a video that was beautiful for its own sake, that didn't rely upon the follies of others, would do more toward undermining those follies than would a video that pointed them all out.",
      "And so, I tossed aside my desire to confine _The Way of Kings_ into a single, pithy sentence explaining the slant I was taking on the fantasy genre. I just wrote it as what it was."

      "Is there a pressure that has developed from traditional publishers for their authors to be pushed towards more production? When should an author consider self-publishing instead of trying to land a book deal in NY? Should one self-publish while trying to land that book deal and use potential sales numbers as part of the pitch?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I don't feel that there has been any push from New York to publish books at any different speed at all. In fact, one of the main reasons to publish with New York as opposed to self-publishing is if you are an author who doesn't write at least one book a year. If we're to take _The Way of Kings_ as an example, there's no way that I'm going to be producing 400,000-word epic fantasies as fast as a lot of the self-published writers can put out books. There's no way that anyone could have made that book at that speed. It's a book that takes a year, maybe eighteen months to write. So for long epic fantasies, New York certainly has some things going for it.",
      "One of the reasons that it's really good to publish fast and short when you're doing self-publishing is that you don't have any sort of marketing push behind you. You don't have bookstore shelf presence, which is one of the major forms of marketing'people seeing your book there on the shelves. Word of mouth is always the most important thing, but it becomes even more important for the self-published writer. Publishing quickly and getting a lot of books out helps to get your name in more places in the market and helps to push some of that momentum through. That seems to be the key way to make it as a self-published writer.",
      "When would I self-publish versus New York-publish? I would not abandon either model. Self-publishing has proved itself so viable recently that if I were a new writer, I would be looking at doing both at the same time. Maybe taking the longer, more epic-style books to New York and doing the faster-paced, more thriller-style books online, and seeing what works best.",
      "So the expansion of the e-book market gives you more places to go. That said, if you're not a particularly fast writer, self-publishing is going to be a very hard route for you because everything I've seen'granted, I'm not an expert on this; there are places to go other than me for expertise'shows that being able to produce quickly is a key factor in being a successful self-published author in this market."

So if someone is in high school or college, a person in their teens or twenties, and they think they might want to be a writer but they don't know how to begin or are concerned about the effort, you know, any of the concerns people have, what is your guidance?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Number one, and most important, is just to keep doing it. Make good habits. Set aside a time, at least once a week, where you can spend some time writing and working on your craft. And don't worry about publishing. In fact, don't be afraid of being bad at it. A lot of people who begin writing, they assume because they've been taught writing, how to write, the actual physical mechanics of it, that storytelling will come to them naturally. And it will over time, but it's as hard to learn as maybe learning to play the piano or something like this. And most people don't expect to sit down and play the piano beautifully their first try. And in the same way, most people who sit down to write books aren't great their first try. So just remember to learn to fall in love with the process. I do have a podcast about writing. It's called [Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/). You can go there and listen in, I've got some advice there. You can find that also linked through my website, [brandonsanderson.com](http://brandonsanderson.com/).",

So you can go to my website and actually download the PDF of _Warbreaker_ completely for free to give a try if you want to try out my work and see what kind of writing I do.",
      "And I love new media. I love using things like Facebook and Twitter to connect with my readers. Because as I said, my readers are my patrons. It's much like if you were living in the 19th century, you would have a wealthy patron often as an artist who would pay for your upkeep while you were creating art, just because they were a lover of the arts. Well, I feel that my readers are much the same thing. They love science fiction and fantasy, they love supporting artists, and it's because of them that I get to do this. And so I try to do whatever I can to connect with them.",
      "For instance, I release on my web site annotations of my books, where I go chapter by chapter and I do a discussion, sort of like a DVD director's commentary, on each chapter. _Elantris_ has those up, and the Mistborn books have those up, where you could read a chapter in the book and then go find out why I wrote what I did, what was going through my mind when I wrote it, these sorts of things. And this is all to try and give as much of a bang for the buck, so to speak, on the books as possible, and to get as much of a connection between me and my readers as possible.",

First up is a live episode recorded at Gen Con Indy that features Shanna Germain talking with Mary, Howard, and me about [writing love scenes](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/09/16/). Next comes an episode on [killing characters](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/09/23/).",
      "The episodes that we recorded in February at Life, the Universe & Everything have already aired on the podcast, but they were also filmed by a good friend of mine, Earl Cahill. If you've wondered what our live episodes look like, you can see them [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD33BCD8E59C164D6):",

      "To what extent has the economy of the world been planned out? Obviously, there's a refreshingly fair amount of economic activity happening in the novels, often times helping to move along the story. But to what extent do you have it planned out already vs. \"I'll come up with it when I need it.\"",
      "That is to say do you know that place A sells to place B, but place B has nothing to sell to place A and so sells to place C, which sells to place A, influencing the trade patterns of ships. And what the price of a horse is in A vs. B vs. C., or the price of an inn for the night, or the price of a pair of well made boots. Have you worked out how people are taxed and tithed, how the trade routes flow, how comparatively wealthy people are around the world, etc?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "For a lot of these things I've done some of it, and for others I decide what to do when I need it. One trick in worldbuilding is to focus your attention on the things that are going to be a source of conflict or passion to the characters. It would be very easy to spend twenty years worldbuilding and never writing. So there is a fair bit of both, but most of what I focus my attention on is where is the conflict. Trade deals are a source of conflict, and so where it's a source of conflict to the cultures I have spent more time dealing with it.",

      "#### Brandon Sanderson",
      "It's much harder for a lighteyes, but the king and the highprinces can raise someone's dahn if they want to. But it is much harder. In the lower dahns, you can buy yourself up in rank. Or you can be appointed. For instance, if you're appointed as a citylord, that is going to convey a certain dahn, and you could jump two or three dahns just by getting that appointment. Now, if you serve poorly, if a lot of the people who have the right of travel leave'which this doesn't happen very often'if your town gets smaller and you're left with this struggling city, you would be demoted a dahn, most likely. If a lot of the citizens got up and left, that would be a sign. They could take away your set status by leaving. That's something that's built into the right of travel. So these things happen.",
      "#### Isilel",
      "If parents have different nahns/dahn's, how is child's position calculated? For instance, if Shallan had married 10-dahner Kabsal, what dahn would their children belong to?",
      "#### Brandon Sanderson",
      "The highest dahn determines the dahn of the child, though that may not match the dahn of the highest parent. For instance, there are certain dahns that aren't conveyed to anyone except for your direct heir. The other children are a rank below. I believe that third dahn is one of the stable ranks. If you're the king, you're first dahn. Your kid inherits. If you have another kid who doesn't marry a highprince, and is not a highprince, then they're going to be third dahn, not second, because that's the stable rank that they would slip down to, along with highlords and the children of highprinces.",
      "#### Isilel",
      "Or, and another thing'what happens if a lighteyed child is born to darkeyes or even slaves? Which should happen often enough, given that male nobles seem rather promiscous. Anyway, are such people automatically of tenth dahn?",
      "#### Brandon Sanderson",
      "The situation is very much taken into account in these sorts of cases. Normally'if there is such a thing as normal with this'one question that's going to come up is are they heterochromatic. Because you can end up with one eye of each color, both eyes light, or both eyes dark. That's going to influence it a lot, what happens here. Do you have any heirs? Was your child born lighteyed? This sort of thing is treated the same way that a lot of societies treated illegitimate children. The question of, do I need this person as an heir? Are they born darkeyed? Can I shuffle them off somewhere? Set them up, declare them to be this certain rank. Are you high enough rank to do that? Are you tenth dahn yourself? What happens with all of these things? There's no single answer to that. The most common thing that's probably going to happen is that they are born heterochromatic. Then you're in this weird place where you're probably declared to be tenth dahn, but you may have way more power and authority than that if one parent is of a very high dahn, just as a bastard child in a royal line would be treated in our world.",

      "It's a challenge. Being a writer is a lot like a juggler, keeping the balls in the air. One of the things I worry about is repeating myself. It's a valid thing, making sure you don't do that and keep them separate. I use an extensive wiki for myself and my books. A lot of my childrens' series are breather novels, and things I do between big epics where I don't have to worry so much about continuity. There's a lot of continuity with _The Way of Kings_ and books like that, so it can be very in depth and intensive, so to keep my sanity, every once in a while I'll take a breather.",

      "Hi, I'm a male writer writing fantasy at the moment with a female perspective character. I'm having trouble with the tone whenever my character bumps up against barriers women have to deal with in my universe. I don't want to beat my audience over the head with gender issues or come off as preachy, especially as I'm still new to writing a female character.",
      "My question is, when you were writing your female characters, especially Vin who jumped out at me as a natural but strong female protagonist in a male character dominated genre, did you find her voice came from your previous writing experience, or did you consult much with other authors and/or women you knew? I keep feeling like I should consult some female friends on how I'm writing her, but I don't want to lose my own voice in doing so.",
      "Also, I love your novels. I find fantasy is a genre filled with characters who feel like tropes or someone's DnD character, while your characters jump off the page and walk around. If you have any general tips for writing a realistic person, that would be great. If not, just thanks for writing such great people.",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "I do consult with others. I think it's vital, particularly when writing 'the other' so to speak. Someone who is different from yourself in some fundamental way.",
      "At the same time, every character should be different from yourself in some fundamental way. And, beyond that, there's a trap in thinking \"My character has to think like a woman.\" No, your character has to think like herself. That's an important distinction to make. For every generalization, grouping, or stereotype out there, you can find many, many people who break that mold.",
      "I actually focus on personality, wants, and needs first. Gender is a part of the character as a concept, and it informs how I write the person'but it is secondary to their passions, goals, and temperament.",
      "I'd say write the character first, then consult with your female friends. Let them read the character in the context of her story, and get a read on it. So long as the character is strong and individual, you should be fine. Some pointers will undoubtedly help, of course.",
      "The best way I've found to make someone realistic is to separate them from the plot and ask yourself who they are, and what they'd be doing, if the plot had never come along and swallowed them up.",
      "Thanks for the reply! I was actually at WFC this past year and you gave me great advice about going to the room parties. It was definitely an experience.",
      "I waited eighteen months for a reply'so long, that I'd given up on the book.",

      "I doubt you need a reminder, but the launch of _Warbreaker_ is only about a week away! Barnes and Noble has kindly decided to put it into one of their big summer promotions, and has ordered a LOT of copies. This is fantastic, since'if you've been reading the blog for a few years'you know that we've consistently had troubles with distribution at Barnes and Noble. Well, they've thrown themselves behind this book a great deal. Finally. So, of course, my natural panic rises that now we won't sell any copies, will prove them right for not supporting the Mistborn books to the extent we wanted, and go back to the old model of never having enough copies out. (Sigh. Sorry, it's hard to not worry about these things.)",

There WILL be an official ebook edition to buy, if you want one'and in order to sweeten that deal, we're probably going to be selling the ebook directly through Tor.com with ALL of the annotations included months, even years, before I get them posted on my website. There should be a special deal of some sort for those who bought the hardcover to get the ebook (with annotations) for a fraction of the regular price, but I'm not sure what it will be. You might have to order both through Tor.com, or maybe there will be a rebate. So if you're thinking of getting both editions to grab the annotations and bonus content, then save your receipt on the hardcover just in case. No promises, but maybe there will be something Tor does to promote.",

      "How did you become a writer? If I'm not mistaken you had originally planned to become a doctor...",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "The moment I read my first fantasy novel—it's cliché to say this, but—I said, \"This is me. This is what I'm going to do.\" So I basically directed all of my efforts toward doing that. But my mother really wanted me to be a doctor. Toward the end of high school I let myself be convinced that writing wasn't a realistic career for me, so I started college as a biochemistry major. But before long I realized I just didn't enjoy chemistry and missed writing, so I changed my major and threw myself into writing.",
      "With magic systems, first of all, I'm looking for something that fits the book that I'm writing. So for instance, in Mistborn, I was looking for powers that would enhance what thieves could do. I was also looking for something that had one foot in alchemy, in that kind of \"coming-of-age magic into science\" way. Alchemy is a great example because it's a blend of science and magic... well, really, a blend of science and superstition, because the magic part doesn't work. So something resonates there.",
      "I'm also looking for interesting ways to ground the magic in our world, and using something mundane is a great way to do that. Magic is naturally fantastical, and so if I can instead use something normal, and then make it fantastical, it immediately creates a sort of ease of understanding. Burning metals sounds so weird, but it was chosen for that same reason, because we gain a lot of our energy through metabolism. We eat something, we turn the sugars into energy, boom. So that's actually a very natural feeling. When I started writing out some sample things, it felt surprisingly natural, that people eat metal and gain powers, even though it sounds so weird. It's because of this kind of natural biology. So I'm looking for that.",
      "Once I have a magic system, I look for really great limitations. Limitations really make a magic system work better. A good limitation will force you to be creative, and your characters to be creative. Pushing and pulling metals is basically telekinesis, right? But by making it center of mass, you can only pull directly towards yourself or push directly away from yourself... Number one: it's vector science. It has one foot in sciences. Number two: it feels very natural to us because this is how we manipulate force ourselves. Number three: it limits things so much that it forces creativity upon the characters. There's that sweet spot, where they can be creative and do cool things, where it doesn't become too limited, but it also keeps you from having too much power in the hands of the characters, so they are still being challenged. I'm looking for all that, and on top of that I want to have good sensory ways to use magic.",
      "I don't want to have two wizards staring at each other, and then be like \"and they stared at each other _very deeply_! And then they _stared_ harder!\" I don't want it all to be internal, which is where the lines for the metals came from. You see something, you push it forward. The pulses that some of the Allomancers use, they'll hear. I wanted sensory applications.",
      "Since I just started coming out with the Stormlight Archive, I want to commit myself to that and don't want to dig into the second Mistborn trilogy for quite a while. Yet I want to prep people for the idea that Mistborn is going to be around for a while, and they are going to be seeing more books. I didn't want it to just come out of nowhere at them in ten years or whenever I get to it. So I decided to do some interim stories.",
      "One of the things I'd been playing with was the idea of what happened between the epic fantasy and the urban fantasy trilogies. We have some very interesting things happening in the world, where you've got a cradle of mankind created (by design) to be very lush, very easy to live in, so a great big city could grow up there relatively quickly; civilization could build itself back up over the course of just a couple of generations. Yet there would be very little motivation to leave that area at first, which I felt would mean that you'd end up with this really great frontier boundary. The dichotomy between the two—the frontier and the quite advanced (all things considered) city in the cradle of humanity—was very interesting to me. So I started playing around with where things would lead.",
      "To worldbuild the urban fantasy trilogy coming up, I need to know everything that happened in the intervening centuries. Some stories popped up in there that I knew would happen, that would be referenced in the second trilogy. So I thought, why don't I tell some of these stories, to cement them in my mind and to keep the series going.",
      "I started writing _The Alloy of Law_ not really knowing how long it would be—knowing the history and everything that happened, but not knowing how much of it I wanted to do in prose form. Things just clicked as they sometimes do, and I ended up turning it into a novel."

      "Question",
      "One thing I really liked on your books is that you've reinvented a lot of fantasy tropes in a lot of good ways. But you also are inspired by some literary works, you've mentioned _Les Miserables_, which is a fantastic novel. So I was just wondering if what advice would you have for people in terms of speculative fiction and literary works?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "Well, advice for drawing. We did a writing excuses podcast on this, so you can go look up those, 'How to be influenced consciously.' But boy. Read good stuff, and start to think about why it's good. It's going to help you. I don't know if I can specifically tell you anything other than that, but read it, decide what 's working for you, and try to use that, try to feel. But remember to feel what they did, not what they did. Meaning, here's a good example. You read Tolkein. You say 'Wow'. What Tolkein did wasn't creating Elves and Dwarves. What Tolkein did was create an interesting mythology that was well interconnected. And a lot of people will say well, I want to learn from Tolkein, so I will use what he did, and they don't dig that level deeper. They say 'Well, I'm going to use the elves and dwarves.' They don't say 'What is it that he did the level down that really made this work?' And that's what you should be emulating. So when you read the classics, say 'What's making it work?' Try to dig the level deeper if that makes sense.",
      "This is something I do by instinct more than by planning. I grow my characters, so I often describe it as I 'cast' my characters, I'll put different people in the role, I'll sit down and say 'okay, here is a character to play this role.' I'll start writing them, and seeing their personality, and seeing the world through their eyes, and I'll see if that works. If it doesn't, I'll actually drop that and rewrite that scene with a different personality, a different character, have someone else walk in and try the role. I'll do that a couple of times till they click. When they click, I basically know who they are. From that point on, I don't have any problems keeping then right. When I write a book when a character doesn't click, then that book often fails. Sometimes they click halfway through, and I have to go back and fix them. Sometimes they're just 90% there, and I just need to keep writing and figure it out as I go. But sometimes, that never quite works, and this is the reason sometimes'there is this book named _Liar of Partinel_, which I never released, because the character never clicked. And people will say 'Let me read it, let me read it!' but it will predispose you to that character, and that character, that personality is the wrong person. So I don't know how I keep them all straight. It just works with characters.",
      "But that's just with characters. With plot and things, I've got to write it down, for setting I've got to write it down, I actually have a big wiki that I build that I reference to keep everything straight. Characters I never have to be that way. They just work.",
      "So I can't give you good advice on that, because it's simply how I do it. And they just grow into their own person.",
      "How long before is the game going to be? I remember you saying it was going to be before _Final Empire_, but I was wondering how long before?",

And that's mostly a mistake, though the thing is the Role Playing Game came to me and said 'Is it feasible that this could happen?' And I said 'It's perhaps feasible, but only a very rare individual could make this work if they knew exactly what they were doing.' And so I said 'Yeah, go ahead, but make it a power that someone really has to know what they're doing to make it work.' And so they put it in, and so Peter assumed that it was canon, that anyone can do it, but that's not what I intended.",
      "#### MEMBER OF AUDIENCE",
      "So would it be easier to say that somebody discovered they could do it and now they are training copperclouds to do it?",
      "#### BRANDON SANDERSON",
      "I would say that it is viable that someone could figure it out, but it would be a very difficult thing to train, and it is not a common Coppercloud'A common Coppercloud isn't going to be able to be doing it, and almost no Mistborn will ever be capable of doing it, they just don't focus on that metal enough to learn it. Of course, there aren't Mistborn around anymore. So it is a possible power, it is plausible, but it is not the standard. Perhaps I will allow it to become the standard eventually, but it's not right now. It would be much easier to wear a tinfoil hat. (laughter) Aluminum, aluminum. Which does work."

      "Aon Omi is best known as the official symbol of the Korathi church in Arelon. It was chosen by Korath (known as KoWho in JinDo) himself to represent the church and God. Scholars of the time say that Korath made the decision late in his life, after decades spent preaching his interpretations of the tenets of Shu-Keseg (which eventually became the Korathi religion) in Arelon and Elantris itself.",
      "The choice was shocking to many, as the young Korathi devout saw the Elantrians and their worship as a competing religion. Their Aons, the basis for Elantrian magic an power, were then regarded as heathen symbols. Korath was always bothered by this competitive streak in his believers, and it is widely accepted that he picked an Aon to represent God and his religion as an attempt to show that all people were acceptable beneath the blanket of the Korathi doctrines. He himself called the Aon a \"Thing of Beauty\" and asked an Elantrian smith of his acquaintance to craft a silver pendant for him bearing the symbol.",
      "That event, and the subsequent adoption of Aon Omi by the Korathi church, led to the odd relationship between the Elantrians and the Korathi religion which took root in their homeland. (Though, following Korath's death, his right-hand man and follower ShanVen moved the religion's center of operations to Teod instead, where the young monarchy there had embraced Shu-Korath as its official religion.)",
      "Over the years, many other Aons have been adopted by the Korathi religion, but this one'Aon Omi'has remained their most powerful and important symbol. It is used extensively in Korathi religious services, and pendants bearing Aon Omi are commonly worn by the devout. (Many simply call them Korathi pendants, or Korathi religious pendants.) Such pendants are commonly exchanged during Korathi wedding services. (See the end of ELANTRIS the novel for an example.)",
      "Many Korathi priests now look at the use of Aons by their religion as a symbol of the potential unity of all mankind, when different beliefs, sects, and cultures will be drawn together through sincere affection for one another.",

It's called _A Thousand Faces_—I don't know if she'll end up changing that title. But, _Promise of Blood_, very good, highly recommended. And if you're looking for something great, and you haven't tried Terry Pratchett, he's one of my go-to recommendations. I love Pratchett's work. Don't start with the first one. Start with _Guards! Guards!_, or _The Truth_.",

      "[ArchAuthor ()](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy_Bookclub/comments/fuq0p/qa_with_brandon_sanderson/c1is0ig)",
      "How long does it take to make a universe, how deep do you go?",
      "Brandon Sanderson",
      "It depends on the book, honestly. For a thick, multi-volume epic fantasy, I take years working on the world. Such was the case with _The Way of Kings_, and a few of the other massive Epics I'm planning. _Mistborn_ had about a year of planning ahead of time.",
      "Some books, however, I write more freely. I almost always spend a few months working on the world before writing; it's the thing I feel I need best fleshed out. However, it is dangerous as well. Some writers spend all of their time worldbuilding and none of their time writing.",
      "I try to focus my energies on areas of worldbuilding important to the conflict and the characters. In _Mistborn_, the languages weren't important'I was going to have everyone speaking one language. In _Kings_, language was more important, so I developed the linguistics. (Though that won't be manifest for a few more books.)",
      "First Question: I'm not, naturally, a reviser. I like to plan a book, I like to write the book, but revision is something I drag my feet on. I'm usually okay once I get going, though the line edits are particularly tough on me.",
      "Other annoying issues: The number of things that distract me from actually doing my writing. (Things like business aspects, or travel. I like doing signings and conventions, but the travel to get there is a big hassle.) Also, I don't like negotiating contracts.",
      "The balance of what to provide and what to withhold has more to do with not bogging down this story with details for a future story than it does with trying to tease. In my mind, this book is three things: Kaladin's experiences as a bridgeman 2) Dalinar's decision to do what he does at the end of the book 3) Shallan's first apprenticeship. I wanted to keep the narrative focused on those things, and provide climaxes dealing with those three concepts. Other secrets and teases are more intended to begin setting up future stories.",
      "However, the \"Lost\" effect (making the mysteries so cool that no reveal can live up to them) is in the forefront of my mind. My feeling is that instead of dragging them eight books, I should be quick to give answers in future volumes. The things that span eight books as secrets shouldn't be the ones that you're wondering at in the first book; they should be the things that, after you begin wondering about them in the seventh book, you can look back to the first book and see the hints. Then you get your answers in the eighth."

I thought you just wrote a book and then you sold it. And sure, that happens to people sometimes. But for most of us, learning to write a book is like learning to play the piano. When you first start, you're not very good. And just like you wouldn't record your first piano sessions and sell them, your first attempts at stories are probably not going to be worth selling. That doesn't mean they aren't worth writing. They are worth writing. But just keep in your mind, it's all right to practice for a while and spend some time really turning yourself into a writer."
